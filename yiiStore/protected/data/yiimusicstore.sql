(1, 'AC/DC', '<p>AC/DC are an Australian hard rock group formed in 1973 by ex-pat Scottish brothers Angus and Malcolm Young. They are hugely successful, having sold in excess of 150 million albums worldwide, with Back in Black ranking as the fifth highest-selling album of all time in the US.</p><p>Their first album High Voltage was released in Australia in 1975, but after Highway to Hell (1979), the album which broke them in the US, their charismatic vocalist Bon Scott died from acute alcohol poisoning. Plans to split were abandoned when they recruited Englishman Brian Johnson to replace him.</p><p>Back in Black had been started with Scott, but Johnson helped finish it and the album went on to sell more than 21 million copies, a double-diamond classification, in the US alone. It spawned the hit singles "Hells Bells", "You Shook Me All Night Long", and "Back in Black".</p><p>For Those About to Rock We Salute You was similarly successful, but following albums began to suffer a slight decline in popularity - though they continued to win awards, score big hits, and perform massive gigs. AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.</p><p>With sixteen studio albums in their catalog, AC/DC haven''t released a studio album since 2000''s Stiff Upper Lip. However, a boxed DVD set Plug Me In (2007) details the high spots of their career to date.</p>', '/images/artists/ACDC.jpg'),
(2, 'Accept', '<p>The Present</p><p>After quite a few years away from the visible hard rock scene, Germany’s legendary ACCEPT have returned to the metal forefront with an elated new singer, a euphoric new album, and global tours. Yes, ACCEPT are back to carry on the timeless tradition of the infectious, immediately identifiable ACCEPT sound, but with fresh ideas and a matured outlook on music and life. A new era begins!</p><p>Early Years (1968–1982)</p><p>The band''s career began in 1976, when the initial stable and professional line-up of ACCEPT (vocalist Udo Dirkschneider, guitarists Wolf Hoffmann and Gerhard Wahl, bassist Peter Baltes and drummer Frank Friedrich) was invited to play at one of the first rock and roll festivals from Germany — Rock am Rhein. Following the festival, the band received their first recording deal. It was the self-titled ACCEPT album. Friedrich and Wahl quit the band after the release of ACCEPT, as they did not intend to pursue a professional career in music. They were soon replaced by new drummer Stefan Kaufmann and guitarist Jörg Fischer. This line-up proceeded to record the sophomore record, I''m A Rebel in 1980. The title track originally was written for AC/DC but they never released it. This was the album that finally brought initial media attention to the band.</p><p>1981 saw three major events in the early history of ACCEPT. First, the acclaimed album Breaker was released. Second, a contract with manager Gaby Hauke was signed, an agreement that is still in effect today. Third, ACCEPT joined Judas Priest''s world tour and obtained a fair amount of success, making the band known outside of Europe.</p><p>The next album, Restless And Wild, was released in 1982. Restless And Wild saw an evolution in the band''s personality and sound, which incorporated several characteristics of a revolutionary new genre which would later be called “speed metal.” This recording however, did not include Jörg Fischer, who quit the band a short time before the studio sessions took place. Jan Koemmet was hired as ACCEPT''s new guitarist, but departed from the band before the recording sessions for the album. The line-up was eventually completed with Herman Frank on second guitar.</p><p>Mainstream Success (1983–1987)</p><p>\r\nACCEPT became hugely successful with their next release, the now legendary Balls To The Wall album (1983). The new album would prove to be quite different from their earlier works. The album was conceptual in nature, and included songs that spoke about politics, sexuality and various human relationships. For example, the classic title track "Balls To The Wall" refers to slaves revolting against oppressing masters. "Fight It Back" is about the social misfits, fighting against conformity. All songs were credited to ACCEPT and "Deaffy." Deaffy was later exposed to be their manager Gaby Hauke''s pseudonym for her contribution to the band''s lyrics. She proceeded to compose the lyrics of all of the songs, with a few exceptions, from that album on. She did not officially reveal authorship of the songs until much later.</p><p>During a show in their hometown of Solingen in 1983, the band ran into Jörg Fischer by chance. On Gaby Hauke''s insistence, Fischer was asked to rejoin the band once again. A world tour followed which would take them through all of 1984 — with the historic Monsters of Rock festival as a mid-year highlight.</p><p>Metal Heart was released in 1985. Produced by Scorpions producer Dieter Dierks, it presented the creative career high for the band. ACCEPT went on to tour around the globe in front of packed houses, soon documented by the live album Kaizoku-Ban. A year later, in 1986, Russian Roulette continued the series of critically acclaimed albums. But in 1987, in spite of their tremendous success, ACCEPT and Udo decided together that Udo would embark on a solo career to pursue his own happiness. Supporting this decision, the songwriting team of ACCEPT wrote an entire album for him. ACCEPT and their management were eager to help Udo launch this solo career. That album was released in 1987 with the title Animal House under the band moniker U.D.O., a band that Udo Dirkschneider continues to tour with to date.</p><p>David Reece Period and First Hiatus (1988–1991)</p><p>During the work on Animal House, ACCEPT had already started to search for and audition for a new vocalist. They soon found David Reece and so Peter, Wolf and Stefan set to work once more on new music. Udo''s solo career was having a good start, and guitarist Jörg Fischer again decided to leave ACCEPT. ACCEPT and their record company felt excited and confident with this new line-up and came out with the worldwide release, Eat The Heat.</p><p>The career of ACCEPT, unfortunately, came to a sudden halt when Stefan Kaufmann sustained a serious injury to his back in the middle of a tour. He was briefly replaced by drummer Ken Mary for the remainder of the short US tour. By its end, Hoffmann, Baltes and Hauke decided that without Stefan and with differences surfacing between the band and Reece, it was time to re-evaluate their next steps. Stefan, always a vital part of ACCEPT, needed a long recovery time. So, by the end of 1989, the band had ceased its activities.</p><p>Reunion with Dirkschneider (1992–1996)</p><p>The live album entitled Staying A Life that was recorded back in 1985, was released in 1990 as a souvenir from their career. During a visit to Germany a few years later, the musicians from ACCEPT and Dirkschneider met and spontaneously decided to relaunch the band with the core members Hoffmann, Kaufmann, Dirkschneider and Baltes.</p><p>The album Objection Overruled was released worldwide in 1993. The band''s reunion was a qualified success in Europe and the USA. A world tour followed. Another album, entitled Death Row, was released in 1994, but Kaufmann became unable to play once more due to his recurring back injury. The band invited Stefan Schwarzmann as a temporary replacement and commenced plans for their next tour.</p><p>A sense of finality was in the air when the band entered studios to record Predator from 1996, this time with Michael Cartellone (from Damn Yankees) on the drums. Predator was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee with Udo''s long time (school) friend and producer Michael Wagener at the helm. In spite of genuine efforts by everyone, the chemistry between ACCEPT and Udo was again strained. ACCEPT''s final tour, supporting Predator, went through America, Europe and Asia, with their last concert in Tokyo, Japan, one of the world capitals of heavy metal. Udo couldn''t wait to return to his own solo project U.D.O.</p><p>\r\nSecond Hiatus and Brief Resurrection (1997–2005)</p><p>The future of ACCEPT was uncertain between 1997 and 2005, as all members continue working on their own projects. However, in 2005, ACCEPT received an invitation from European promoters to embark on a short summer European Festival tour with ACCEPT''s classic line-up (Hoffmann, Baltes, Dirkschneider, Frank und Schwarzmann). Everyone agreed to do these festivals, which turned out to be a stunning success. The last show was held on August 27, 2005, in Kavarna, Bulgaria - at the Kaliakra rock fest. No further activities were in the cards as Udo had already released a new album and was obligated to continue with his own band U.D.O.</p><p>Asked in May 2007 by Lords Of Metal webzine if ACCEPT were planning on writing and recording new material in the near future, Dirkschneider replied: “That would be a problem. You know, it''s easy to play the old songs, because they already exist. Especially for me it was easier, because I still do those classics with U.D.O., but for some of the guys it was a bit harder. But everybody did a great job on stage. I understand that people want a new ACCEPT album, but composing songs together would have been a disaster. That way we would destroy more than we would create. We have a good relationship now and it''s best to keep it that way.”</p><p>On May 14, 2009, Udo Dirkschneider officially announced that he would not be participating in the rumored ACCEPT reunion.</p><p>Triumphant Return with Mark Tornillo (2009–present)<br>\r\nAt the end of May 2009, a possible ACCEPT reformation surfaced when bassist Peter Baltes revealed that he spent a weekend at his house in Pennsylvania and "shredding away" with the band''s guitarist Wolf Hoffmann. "Something amazing is in the works," Baltes explained. "As soon as I can, I''ll let everybody know. Let''s make the ''Metal Heart'' beat again." A coincidental meeting between ACCEPT and former TT Quick singer Mark Tornillo at this informal jam session proved to be a life changing event for the band. Shortly after, Mark Tornillo would become the new voice of ACCEPT.</p><p>News of ACCEPT''s return and Mark''s arrival spread around the world like wild fire. Blown away by Mark''s voice, enthusiasm and energy, ACCEPT decided that a new album had to be written and recorded. Producer Andy Sneap (Megadeth, BLAZE, Exodus, Testament, Arch Enemy, Onslaught) a life-long ACCEPT fan, heard the news and immediately flew to America to meet with the band. ACCEPT and Andy clicked immediately and ACCEPT knew right away: They had found the perfect man to produce the new album. Titled Blood Of The Nations, it is the first original album in fourteen years (since 1996''s Predator).</p><p>The new line-up made their live debut on May 8, 2010 at the sold-out Gramercy Theatre in New York City attended by a who’s who in the music industry. Performing for an audience of hundreds of fans, it was their first American concert in fifteen years. They played classic ACCEPT songs and debuted new material.</p><p>On May 21, 2010 their video for "Teutonic Terror" hit #5 on the worldwide video chars in all genres on MySpace, topping such artists as Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber and Christina Aguilera. The video also topped the MySpace Global Metal Charts at #1.</p><p>In May and June, ACCEPT opened for AC/DC at concerts in Hannover and Stuttgart, Germany, and on June 25, 2010 they were headliners in the Sonisphere festival in Romania and Turkey, playing for 2 hours, including their classics "Balls to the Wall," "Metal Heart," and "Princess of the Dawn." ACCEPT also played tracks off their new album. Blood Of The Nations was released in Europe on August 20, 2010 to sensational reviews and made an astounding chart debut at Number 4 in the official German Media Control Charts. It marks the band’s highest chart debut in their entire career.</p><p>Blood Of The Nations was then released on September 4 in Japan, and September 18, 2010 in North America, where it debuted at #187 on The Billboard 200 chart, #170 on the Top Current Albums chart, and on the #41 Independent (Current) Albums chart. In Canada, Blood Of The Nations debuted at #53 on the Nielsen Soundscan Top Hard Albums chart.\r\n</p><p>Throughout the summer, ACCEPT spent 80 days traveling over 40,400 miles and played in front of over 450,000 fans. In late October, the band appeared at the prestigious Japanese Festival Loudpark along such artists as Ozzy Osbourne, Motörhead and Stone Sour. The rest of the year will be spent preparing for a major European Tour in the early parts of 2011.</p><p>Like a caged animal set free at last, ACCEPT is back! In a world where metal has become imitative and stale, ACCEPT once again press forward with honest, visionary musical vigor and a dose of Teutonic Terror. See them on tour in 2011....</p>', '/images/artists/Accept.jpg'),
(3, 'Aerosmith', '<p>Aerosmith is the American hard rock band fronted by the charismatic and craggy faced frontman Steven Tyler who, following a self-induced implosion in the early 1980s, went on to stage one of the most successful comebacks in rock history. Over the course of their long career they have released fourteen albums, many of which are platinum certified.</p>\r\n<p>The band earned its stripes in the early days by touring, so their audience was already established by the release of their first album, Aerosmith, in 1973. Although it was a moderate success at the time, their breakthrough album was 1975''s Toys in the Attic. This was the album that allowed them to shrug off the ''Rolling Stones clones'' tag and be accepted as a band worthy of note in their own right. ''Sweet Emotion'', from that album, was their first hit single and prompted the re-release of ''Dream On'', which reached No.6 in the charts. Toys in the Attic remains their best selling album, having sold eight million copies to date.</p>\r\n<p>By the end of the 70s the popularity of the band was beginning to decline somewhat, but more notable was their predilection for substance abuse and other trappings of the rock and roll lifestyle. The albums began to suffer and founder members began to peel away, with Perry leaving after 1979''s Night in the Ruts, and Whitford leaving in 1981.</p>\r\n<p>In 1984 the band were re-united and embarked on a comeback tour, and released the album Done with Mirrors. Unfortunately the album was only a moderate success; the real comeback started in 1986 when a cover of Aerosmith''s 1977 hit ''Walk This Way'' was released. This was a collaborative effort with Run D.M.C. splicing their hip-hop with Aerosmith''s original rock and roll. It reached No.4 on the Billboard charts and introduced the band to a younger generation of listeners. This spurred efforts to get the band members clean over the next few years, since their addictions were encumbering them.</p>\r\n<p>The next release was 1987''s Permanent Vacation, the first release of a newly clean band and a major success. All three singles -- ''Dude (Looks Like a Lady)'', ''Rag Doll'' and ''Angel'' -- reached the Billboard Top 20. Pump (1989) continued the run of success with its Top 10 singles ''Janie''s Got a Gun'', ''What It Takes'', and ''Love in an Elevator''. ''Janie''s Got a Gun'' earned Aerosmith the first of their four Grammy Awards.\r\n<p>Following albums continued their success throughout the 90s, though their decision to draft in professional songwriters in a bid for increased commercial success led to the inevitable accusations that they had ''sold out''. Their most recent release was 2004''s bluesy Honkin'' on Bobo.', '/images/artists/arrowsmith.jpg'),
(4, 'Alanis Morissette', '<p>A dozen years after the breakthrough debut of Jagged Little Pill, an album which earned four Grammys, sold 30 million records and spawned a dedicated worldwide fan base, Alanis Morissette remains not only an enduringly popular artist, but one whose success stems from a fierce commitment to authenticity and, to an equal extent, vulnerability. Both of these traits enable her to climb to new ground on her new Maverick/Reprise album, Flavors of Entanglement.</p><p>Her current collaborator is British electronica producer Guy Sigsworth (Björk, Imogen Heap), who co-wrote the music with Morissette and produced the album. Nearly two dozen songs were born from writing sessions in London and Los Angeles and eleven were selected for the final cut of Flavors of Entanglement. While hewing to a familiar process – creating songs as snapshots of her life – Morissette found cathartic support during a big transition in her life. “I often write in retrospect, but this time all was written in real time,” she says. “These songs served as an outlet and marking of this massively growthful time.”</p><p>Her penchant for eclecticism, whether musical, spiritual or otherwise, brought new sounds and styles into this latest effort, her first original studio album in four years. Eastern percussion and strings blend with electronic hues in the opening track, “Citizen of the Planet,” a poetic narrative of her life story and transnational perspective. Morissette’s yin/yang view of the microcosmic self being evidenced in the macrocosmic world extends to lead single “Underneath,” which reflects the quote: “don’t try to carpet the world……just wear slippers.”</p><p>While deconstructing human behavior in the jarring “Versions of Violence,” Morissette offers a more personal take on being on the receiving end of crazy-making behavior with songs such as the hard-driving “Straitjacket,” the hauntingly beautiful lost-love lament of "Torch," the clear declaration of “Moratorium,” the hypnotic ebb and flow of "Tapes," and grateful in the aspirational “In Praise of the Vulnerable Man.” Morissette explores the often cyclical nature of learning in tracks such as the pensive, rock bottom-capturing “Not As We,” and the ecstatic freedom of “Giggling Again for No Reason,” before wrapping with the Phoenix-rising closure of "Incomplete."</p><p>"There''s not another artist—male or female—who can take you on the kind of emotional journey that Alanis can," says Sigsworth. "She has this ginormous, super-massive, planet-eating emotional range. She goes all the way-10 on the Richter Scale-and we''re at the epicenter with her as she sings whole worlds into existence. She can be raging and hostile, distraught and desolately heartbroken, glowingly nostalgic, sensual, breezy and self-deprecating-all in one album."</p><p>Born and raised in Ottawa, Canada, and Germany, Alanis Morissette began playing piano at the age of six, started to write songs at the age of nine and discovered a love of words and dance at an early age. At 11 she joined the cast of “You Can’t Do That On Television,” a popular children’s television program. She used some of the money she made on that show to start a record company with a friend and fund an independent single called “Fate Stay With Me.” At fourteen, Morissette signed a publishing contract and eventually a record deal with MCA Canada, releasing the album Alanis in 1991, which went platinum and for which she won Canada’s Juno Award for Most Promising Female Artist. Her follow-up album, Now Is The Time, was released the following year.</p><p>It was 1994, when Morissette came to the U.S. and began working with producer Glen Ballard, that she found her own voice as a singer-songwriter. “I was 19 when I first felt that writing was a channeled experience. That has a lot to do with where I was at then, having met Glen, moving from Canada and moving away from any preconceived notions of how songs ‘should’ be written. It was the beginning of a new way to approach songwriting altogether,” she explains, “I was old enough to be able to write autobiographically and stand by the philosophical subject matter in my songs.”</p><p>The result of their collaboration was Jagged Little Pill (Maverick Records), an emotionally raw collection of songs that introduced Morissette to the world and broke countless records worldwide. With heavy-rotation singles like “You Oughta Know,” “Head Over Feet,” “Hand in My Pocket” and “Ironic,” it became the best-selling debut album by a female artist in the U.S., and the highest-selling debut album worldwide. Jagged Little Pill won four Grammys in all, including Album of the Year and Best Rock Album, and Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for “You Oughta Know.” A fifth Grammy for Best Music Video Long-Form was bestowed upon Morissette for her music documentary: Jagged Little Pill Live. Morissette hauled in two more Grammys for Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the string-laden rock ballad “Uninvited”, written for the Wim Wenders remake of City of Angels which hit #1 on Billboard’s Top 40 Mainstream chart.</p><p>Her next album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart with record-setting first-week sales of nearly 470,000 copies. The Grammy-nominated single “Thank U” also reached #1 on the Adult Top 40 chart and #2 on Top 40 Mainstream. The MTV acoustic forum “Unplugged” yielded Alanis Unplugged in 1999.</p><p>Throughout the first half of the new decade, Alanis Morissette continued evidencing that she was an artist with something to say, and she would say it in her own distinct way. In 2002 Under Rug Swept debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, its single “Hands Clean” reaching #3 on the Adult Top 40 chart. Two years later came So-Called Chaos, whose single “Everything” became an Adult Top 40 mainstay and “Eight Easy Steps” became a club hit as a dance mix. Morissette celebrated the ten-year anniversary of her breakthrough album with 2005’s Jagged Little Pill Acoustic. In November of that year, The Collection amassed a best-of anthology with 17 tracks that delivered favorites from previous albums as well as a well-received cover of Seal’s “Crazy” (an interesting foreshadowing, as it was originally co-written and produced by her future Flavors of Entanglement collaborator Guy Sigsworth).</p><p>Achieving success as a recording and performing artist, Morissette has lent her talents to other albums and forums. She’s been a guest vocalist on Ringo Starr’s cover of “Drift Away” on his album Vertical Man, “Don’t Drink the Water” and “Spoon” on the Dave Matthews Band album Before These Crowded Streets and other CDs. She wrote “Still” for the soundtrack of the controversial film Dogma and, after steadfast offerings by director Kevin Smith, agreed to play the role of God.</p><p>More recently Morissette appeared in the Cole Porter biopic De-Lovely and performed the classic “Let’s Do It (Let’s Fall in Love),” also contributing the song “Wünderkind” to the soundtrack of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song). As well as the aforementioned song entitled “Uninvited”, written for City of Angels, she contributed songs for the movies Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Clerks II, The Break-Up and The Devil Wears Prada; on screen her other acting work includes roles on HBO’s “Sex and the City” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm” along with a three-episode arc on FX’s “Nip/Tuck.” On stage, Morissette starred in The Vagina Monologues and in the off-Broadway play, (in both New York and London) The Exonerated as death row inmate Sunny Jacobs. She recently completed her first lead film role as "Sylvia" in the film adaptation of Philip K Dick''s novel Radio Free Albemuth.</p><p>She delivered one of the most memorable performances of her career last year with a riotous parody of the Black Eyed Peas'' hit "My Humps." Entertainment Weekly lauded the YouTube sensation, which has been viewed more than 13.5 million times to date, as one of the top downloads of ''07 and praised Alanis for "revisiting the age-old question, ''What you gonna do with all that ass, all that ass inside them jeans?''"</p><p>Among a breadth of charity work, Morissette especially finds time to support environmental causes and organizations, such as Reverb, a non-profit that helps musicians and music fans to achieve environmental sustainability through carbon-neutral initiatives. Morissette was one of the first artists to have her “Feast on Scraps” CD and DVD materials on recycled paper. Initially she paid for this out of her own pocket, but now it’s becoming an industry standard. Her passions also include women’s issues and artists’ rights on behalf of which she has written several articles as well as spoken to congress.</p><p>A dozen years after the world was first turned on to Alanis Morissette, a more mature artist remains committed to her creative path and a strong desire to help others on theirs. “I live to HEAL ruptures and bridge the human and the divine aspects of life, and I hope that by sharing my own experiences through speaking, writing and art, I can support people in their personal journeys, wherever they may be,” she explains. “The initial writing is for me, and the sharing of it is my offering to others to make these songs and writings their own. For people to derive comfort, inspiration, validation or self-definition in accordance to what I write or how I live...this is my service.”</p>', '/images/artists/AlanisMorissette.jpg'),
(5, 'Alice In Chains', '<p>Alice in Chains(Formed in 1987, by guitarist Jerry Cantrell bassist Mike Starr, drummer Sean Kinney and Vocalist Layne Staley) is one of the most influential American rock bands in the early 90''s. Drawing equally from the heavy riffing of metal and the gloomy strains of post-punk, the band developed a bleak sound that balanced grinding metal riffs with subtly textured acoustic numbers. They were hard enough for metal fans than their dark subject and punky attack placed them among the front ranks of the best Seattle-based grunge bands.</p><p>By combining the unique voice and intense delivery of Layne Staley with evocative songwriting and vocal harmonies of Cantrell Alice in Chains created an immediately identifiable sound that also proved to be quite diverse as their repertoire grew to include both driving angry rock songs and mellow acoustic compositions.</p><p>The band found commercial and artistic success in the early 90''s, which stressed Staley''s increasingly clear abuse of heroin. They often found their attempts to follow up the success in the studio or on the road to be hampered by Staley''s erratic drug-fueled behavior. Ultimately, Alice in Chains failed to maintain a consistent career in the post-grunge music world and limped into the break when Cantrell turned its attention to solo projects (which often include contributions from Kinney and Inez) Staley finally succumbed to his grief when he overdosed in April 2002.</p><p>Jerry Cantrell Mike Inez and Sean Kinney reformed and played shows in late 2005 and early 2006 with a variety of guest vocalists including Billy Corgan, Pat Lachman, Wes Scantlin, Maynard James Keenan, Ann Wilson and Phil Anselmo. In Late 2006 William DuVall joined Alice in Chains as a singer in the band''s reunion concert with Velvet Revolver and ex-Guns N ''Roses bassist Duff McKagan. In September 2009 Alice in Chains released their first studio album since 1995 album called "Black gives way to the Blue"</p>', '/images/artists/AliceInChains.jpg'),

Black Sabbath cite disparate influences such as Cream and the Beatles and are, in turn, cited as having influenced artists from System of a Down and Metallica, to Busta Rhymes and the Cardigans.</p><p>Since they began in Birmingham, England in 1968 (under the name Polka Tulk Blues Company), there have been countless line-up changes but the original - and classic - band line-up was Ozzy Osbourne (vocals), Tony Iommi (guitar), Terence "Geezer" Butler (bass), and Bill Ward (drums), responsible for the albums leading up to Ozzy''s last with the band, Never Say Die! (1978). However many well-respected metallists have entered the revolving door of Sabbath membership, (including Ronnie James Dio, Ian Gillan and Cozy Powell) and it is the accumulation of their myriad influences which have shaped the band.</p><p>They have created an extensive back catalogue, which began in 1970 with the release of the classic Black Sabbath. With it, they introduced their trademark sound, beloved of the stoner rockers to follow - slowed down bass, fierce guitar solos, clear up-front vocals and a seeming obsession with the macabre and the occult. Throughout it all has been the backdrop of hirings, firings and, of course, the rock-star behaviour, with drugs and booze aplenty. The reputation and the egos in the band have at times become almost as big as the music, but their infamy has served only to increase their appeal.</p><p>For all their success, critical praise was slow to come.

(22, 'Led Zeppelin', '<p>Led Zeppelin are a highly rated British blues-rock outfit and statistically regarded as one of the most successful rock bands of the seventies. They first formed in 1968 from the remaining members of The Yardbirds, and consisted of Jimmy Page (b. 1944, guitar), Robert Plant (b. 1948, vocals), John Paul Jones (b. 1946, bass guitar / keyboards), and John Bonham (1948-1980, drums). They are considered one of the most influential bands in the world, becoming closely associated with the ''album-oriented rock'' (AOR) format and progenitors of a style of rock music called ''heavy metal'', although the band''s musical output transcended heaviness, with strong blues, folk, psychedelic, classical, Celtic, and world music flavours in their recordings and acoustic live performances. The band also eschewed traditional promotional avenues in the industry, focussing on albums and concerts, without reliance on singles or television performances. The interaction of all four musicians on stage gave their live performances a visual counterpoint to voluminous intertwined harmonic and rhythmic structures of their compositions. Led Zeppelin remain one of the most popular bands of all time, having sold close to 300 million records, and millions of concert tickets worldwide. In the United States, Led Zeppelin has achieved 111.5 million certified unit sales, with all of their studio albums reaching the Billboard Top 10. Since 1985, the band has had several reunions with different drummers, most notably Jason Bonham (b. 1966), son of John Bonham.</p>\r\n<p>Their foundation lay in the legendary R&B outfit The Yardbirds, which guitarist Jimmy Page had joined in June 1966, after initially turning down a previous invitation in February 1965. Just before joining The Yardbirds and during a break in that band''s touring, Page was invited by Jeff Beck to consider the possibility of forming a ''supergroup'' based around a twin-lead guitar attack which included himself on 12-string with his friend Beck, and a rhythm section featuring bass player John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon with the addition of keyboardist Nicky Hopkins. Entwistle pulled out at the last minute to be replaced by John Paul Jones, but the project encountered problems over the vocal spot with both Steve Winwood and Steve Marriott all being unavailable. The project recorded the Page composition ''Beck''s Bolero'' and a cover ''Louie, Louie'' at London''s IBC Studios on May 16 before Hopkins and Moon left, believing the project would go over ''like a lead zeppelin''. Page finally joined The Yardbirds with Beck, but he kept the idea of a supergroup and the sarcastic phrase for future use.</p>\r\n<p>By June 1968, The Yardbirds were drifting apart over musical direction. After a tour of the United States and a final gig with members Keith Relf and Jim McCarty at the Luton College of Technology, on July 7, 1968, members Page, bass player Chris Dreja, and manager Peter Grant resolved to continue as a blues-rock combo, initially to play out a previously booked 10-day tour of Scandinavia, dubbed by the media as The New Yardbirds. With the line-up unsettled, session drummers Clem Cattini, Aynsley Dunbar, and singer Steve Marriott were considered for auditions and Page also briefly toyed with the idea of inviting back original Yardbird Anthony ''Top'' Topham on rhythm guitar. On July 12, Dreja contacted session drummer Paul Francis, but he was about to leave London for Germany and could not commit to the new line-up. Session man, arranger, bass player and keyboardist John Paul Jones then offered his services to the new group after seeing an article in Disc magazine on the Yardbird''s future plans, which Page kept in mind after a phone call he received on July 19, 1968. Filling the vocal and drummer spots were more of a dilemma. Due to contractual impasse Terry Reid (previously managed by Grant, now managed by Mickie Most) and B.J. Wilson (of Procol Harum) declined the respective positions, but Reid recommended an acquaintance of his, 19-year-old Midlands-born ex-Band of Joy vocalist Robert Plant. Page, Dreja and Grant went to see Plant perform live with a band called Obs-tweedle at the Birmingham Teacher Training College on July 20, 1968 and were duly impressed. He was invited back to Page''s Pangbourne boathouse to discuss joining the new group and discovered he shared similar musical tastes with Page. Plant signed up and in turn recommended his former Band of Joy colleague John Bonham, who was drumming for both Chris Farlowe and Tim Rose. Page and Grant travelled to the Country Club at Hampstead, North London, on July 31, to watch Bonham perform and both agreed he was ideal for the band, and following over 30 invitational telegrams sent by Grant to persuade him, Bonham joined. In the event Dreja decided to pursue a career in photography, eventually setting up a freelance studio in New York, leaving Page to find a new bass player by August 4. He promptly recruited John Paul Jones, whom he''d known for years in session work, having last worked together on The Yardbird''s Little Games album in 1967. What was also in Jones'' favour was his additional keyboard and arranging abilities, and valuable studio experience. All four musicians then met for a rehearsal at a basement studio, located below a record store in Gerrard Street, London on August 12, 1968 and musically gelled together as a unit immediately. Their first song attempted was The Yardbirds standard ''Train Kept a Rollin'''' followed by a run through a Band of Joy favourite, Garnet Mimms'' ''As Long as I Have You'', ''I Can''t Quit You Baby'', and a version of Howlin'' Wolf''s ''Smokestack Lightnin''''. Jones later said ''As soon as I heard John Bonham play, I knew this was going to be great... We locked together as a team immediately.'' Within days the group entered Lansdowne Recording Studios in Bayswater, London to record ''Jim''s Blues'' and ''Merry Hopkins Never Had Days Like These'' with Texan-born singer P. J. Proby, from an arranging session pre-booked by Jones.</p>\r\n<p>This new outfit completed The Yardbirds'' final contractual obligations in Scandinavia, with tour manager Jerry Ritz, and their first gig at the Teen Clubs - Box 45, Gladsaxe in Denmark on September 7, 1968, at 7.30 pm, was followed by a second show at the Brøndby Pop Club in Copenhagen. With the tour concluded on September 16, the band then entered Olympic Studios in Barnes, West London recording their own eponymous début album within 30 hours on a budget of only £1750 (including artwork), with sessions starting on September 27, assisted by engineer Glyn Johns. The first two compositions recorded were ''Babe I''m Gonna Leave You'' and ''I Can''t Quit You Baby'', on 4-track tape. Although originally booked in the studio as The Yardbirds, the album eventually released as Led Zeppelin, and produced by Page, showcased their brand of folk, eastern and blues-rock fusion with Plant''s powerful vocal style and Page''s accomplished guitar work being tight and urgent. Page wanted the sound as close as possible to those early live shows; he didn''t want anything that couldn''t be reproduced live effectively with just the four of them. Part of the astonishing presence and depth of those recordings came from the way he placed microphones in the room, to get varying sounds of vibrancy and decay. ''Distance is depth,'' was Page’s maxim. The tracks recorded also displayed Page''s musical credence in ''light and shade'' – music punctuated with both quieter and heavier dynamics, and two in particular - ''Communication Breakdown'' and ''Dazed and Confused'' – have served as templates for much subsequent rock music. With the recordings concluded they then performed a series of gigs in the United Kingdom, beginning with the Mayfair Ballroom in Newcastle on October 4, and other bookings subsequently followed such as The Marquee on October 18, 1968 and Liverpool University on October 19, before changing their name permanently to Led Zeppelin, based on a humorous idiom of Keith Moon as far back as May 1966. Moon had often used the phrase ''go over like a lead zeppelin'', which Page liked and Grant promoted with a dropped ''a'' to preclude any mispronunciation. On October 22, Grant and Page then registered the band''s own publishing company under the tongue-in-cheek name of Superhype Music, Inc. to ensure all songwriting royalties would accrue independently. The first public appearance under their new moniker was at Surrey University on October 25, 1968. On October 28, Led Zeppelin was signed to Atlantic Records by label Executive Vice-President Jerry Wexler in New York, at the recommendation of Dusty Springfield and producer Bert Berns for a then record negotiated advance of US$200,000 - an unprecedented amount for a new group whose first album nobody had yet heard. Wexler''s decision was also assisted by Page''s and Jones'' session reputations as well as the announced dissolution of label supergroup Cream, preceding November 1968. Page had particularly sought out Atlantic Records because of its strong historical background with blues, soul and jazz artists, as opposed to other rock acts during the 1960s that were usually being signed with Elektra and Atco.</p>\r\n<p>Even more important, though, were the contract terms that Grant secured: Essentially, Led Zeppelin held control of key clauses. They alone would decide when they would release albums and tour, and they had final say over the contents and design of each album. They also would decide how much they would do to promote each release (not that much beyond tours, though those would be extensive) and which tracks to select as singles (Grant and the band insisted none, despite the label''s many unauthorised attempts). A major band would be working for itself, not for a company or for management (Led Zeppelin had no formal contract with Grant). With the album now in the hands of Atlantic Records, Grant resolved that they should focus on the US market (albums were usually released and promoted first in the US before the UK), and after a few appearances, Grant also concluded that formulaic television programmes were not the best medium to highlight the band’s musical dynamics. This inevitably led to a lack of airplay in their early days, but in the longer term created the sense of mystique that was to sustain them over the coming decade. Grant''s promotional philosophy was that if a person wanted to see or hear the band, they had to go to their concert and experience them. Consequently, the only connection the audience had with the band was through the records and the concerts. The band''s skill at extending and improvising on their studio record repertoire elevated their live shows to something very different from playing their albums. This had the effect of making fans feel like they were members of an exclusive club. Performances would also extend out to 4 hours whereas most concerts by other artists during the 1960s would typically only average 45 minutes. The unwillingness by the band to play by standard industry rules also meant an uneasy relationship with the press, which later resulted in the eventual employment of a full-time publicist and only select interviews given by group members.</p>\r\n<p>Led Zeppelin were originally scheduled to appear on The Rolling Stones Rock ''n'' Roll Circus TV special filmed at Intertel Studios in December, however Mick Jagger felt their sound was too competitive for the line-up after hearing a demo tape of their first album, and replaced them at the last minute with Jethro Tull. On December 26, 1968 they began their first US tour with a concert at the Denver Auditorium in Denver, Colorado, before launching into a cross-country tour of venues handpicked by Grant from his experiences road-managing the Jeff Beck Group - five nights at the Whiskey A Go-Go in Los Angeles, four at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, three at the Boston Tea Party, supporting the likes of Vanilla Fudge, Iron Butterfly, and Alice Cooper. Grant gave local FM radio stations white label copies of their début album in advance for rotation before the tour reached each city, ensuring promotion at a listener level. They were an immediate sensation and midway through that first US tour, on January 12, the group''s début album Led Zeppelin, with its trademark Hindenburg cover art, was released in the US, and it ascended to No.10 on the Billboard charts. British underground counter-culture newspaper OZ enthused, ''it was one of those rare LPs that so defy immediate classification or description, simply because [they are] so obviously a turning point in rock''. They performed frequently, initially in clubs and ballrooms, then in larger auditoriums and eventually stadiums as their popularity strengthened. At the Fillmore East on January 31, Led Zeppelin''s performance was so intense, and the audience reaction so fanatical, that the headliners Iron Butterfly delayed its own onstage arrival by 45 minutes in the hope that the crowd would calm down. Led Zeppelin never went out as a support group again. On March 21, 1969 they made their only live UK TV appearance on a pilot BBC rock show, How Late It Is, followed by a performance of ''Dazed and Confused'' on Supershow in Staines, London on March 25. As the group began its second US tour on April 18, this time at the New York University Jazz festival, ''Good Times Bad Times'' made the US Billboard charts at No.80. On May 10, Led Zeppelin made its belated UK début and rose to a peak of No.6 on the charts. Over the summer of 1969 they played a number of prestigious gigs – the London Playhouse Theatre for BBC Radio''s In Concert show (June 27), the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music (June 28), The Pop Proms (June 29)[32] and the Newport Jazz and Blues Festival in the US during July. Throughout this time they also played many BBC sessions, later compiled and released as the BBC Sessions double CD set. These demonstrate them to have a repertoire not only rooted in the blues, but effortlessly able to incorporate influences from folk, jazz and world music. On October 12, the band appeared at a Sunday Lyceum concert promoted by entrepreneur Tony Stratton-Smith, and received the then highest fee ever paid to a UK band for a one-off concert.</p>\r\n<p>Led Zeppelin II, recorded in various locations as they criss-crossed the US during 1969, was the album which firmly established them as one of the world''s biggest rock bands. Advance orders for the album alone topped 400,000 units and when it was released it became Atlantic Records’ fastest selling album at 100,000 copies a week. Symbolically dislodging The Beatles'' Abbey Road from the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic, it remained in the US charts for 138 weeks and cemented their reputation as the world''s most successful hard-rock artists. Its finest moment was arguably ''Whole Lotta Love'', with its timeless opening riff and experimental midsection. The song itself became a rock anthem and also appeared as a single in the US, where it rose to No.4 despite the group''s reservations. Practically all of 1969 and the first few months of 1970 were spent touring. They played the Royal Albert Hall on January 9. On February 28, they changed their name to the tongue-in-cheek title of The Nobs after Eva von Zeppelin threatened litigation for using her family''s surname, if they performed in Denmark. She never followed through with her threat in any subsequent tours. Upon their arrival for their concert at Mid South Coliseum on April 17, Mayor Henry Loeb of Memphis, Tennessee bestowed members of the band honorary citizenship of the city.</p>\r\n<p>Before recording their next album, Page and Plant spent a few idyllic weeks in 1970 writing in a rustic remote Welsh cottage named Bron-Yr-Aur, later immortalised in two song titles. Led Zeppelin III was more folk-based than its predecessors, but still had a high quota of hard rock songs such as ''Immigrant Song'' and ''Out On the Tiles''. ''Immigrant Song'' was released as a single in the US, where it ascended to No.16. The album also contained some superb acoustic material, and appeared in a variegated sleeve featuring an inner rotating disc. Though some music critic reviews were typically indifferent, sales were again outstanding and it topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Début performances for the new songs came with a brace of Icelandic shows before Led Zeppelin headlined The Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music on June 27, with an audience of over 150,000 in attendance. By now, with The Beatles having split and The Rolling Stones in tax exile, Led Zeppelin was indisputably the world''s top rock group. This was confirmed on September 16, when the band was voted Top Group in the annual Melody Maker poll, ending the Beatles'' unbroken eight year reign with that magazine.</p>\r\n<p>On March 5, 1971, Led Zeppelin began a series of ''thank you'' club shows for its British fans in response to their support during the band''s early performances in 1968. They agreed to play for the original admission fee for that year. The tour started with the band''s first concert in Ireland and in Belfast fans were given the honour of being the first to hear ''Stairway to Heaven'' performed live. Their tour of Italy was interrupted when a police-instigated riot on July 5, prematurely ended a concert at Vigorelli Stadium in Milan. The untitled fourth album, known unofficially as Led Zeppelin IV and also as Four Symbols or Untitled, was released that year and continued the practice of coupling hard rock songs like ''Black Dog'' and ''Rock and Roll'' (which climbed to No.15 and 47 respectively in the US) with subtler material such as ''The Battle of Evermore'', which featured Sandy Denny and reflected Plant''s ongoing preoccupation with Celtic folklore, and the ethereal ''Going to California''. The album also contained the band''s 8 minute and 1 second magnum opus, ''Stairway to Heaven'', with its ballad-like verses and scorching lead break becoming the group''s most identifiable anthem, which will populate ''all time'' song polls and radio airwaves for decades even though it was never officially released as a single. ''Stairway to Heaven'' is often quoted as being the most requested FM radio song of all time, and as a musical statement it encapsulated all the group''s styles into one unified package. Led Zeppelin IV topped the album charts in the UK, but only reached No.2 in the US, perhaps because of the radical decision not to list the band''s name anywhere on the packaging. The band not only wanted the album to be untitled, but wanted nothing written on it: no credits or any text anywhere on the album, on its inside or outside sleeves. They released the album with no indication of who they were in order to prove that their music was the sole focal point. They were eventually talked out of it by Atlantic Records and there were credits added to the inside paper sleeve, but still, nothing was written on the front cover to identify the album or who put it out, and the album was left untitled by the band.</p>\r\n<p>From late 1971 to all of 1972, the band spent months touring the world. Led Zeppelin played a charity concert at Hiroshima''s Shiei Taiikukan on September 27, 1971 for victims of the World War II atomic bombing and were awarded Peace Medals and the Civil Charter by the city. The band used Japan to try out as yet uncommitted to vinyl plus some unexpected cover versions. On February 14, they were refused admission to Singapore because of their long hair which the band refused to cut. They began their first and so-far only Australasian tour on February 16, culminating on a return trip to Bombay, India to record with local orchestras. A planned concert at London''s Waterloo train station had to be cancelled in July due to logistical problems involving conflicting train running times. Before the band commenced their 1972 summer tour of the US, Grant initiated the 90/10 policy on gate receipts with promoters and agents which becomes a standard percentage in the music industry, with almost no opposition due to the audience drawing power the band now had. That drawing power was further confirmed when all 110,000 tickets for their 24-date December 1972-January 1973 UK tour sold out in just four hours.</p>\r\n<p>Houses of the Holy was released in April 1973 and again topped the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic the same month. This was arguably their most diverse album, with tracks ranging from high energy rock to reggae, funk and folky ballads. It went further with experimentation than previous releases, with expanded tracks and versatile use of synthesisers and mellotron orchestration. Highlights of the album include the gothic ''No Quarter'' and the ballad ''The Rain Song''. The striking orange album gatefold cover of Houses of the Holy featured images of children climbing up the Giant''s Causeway in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, based upon Arthur C. Clarke''s novel Childhood''s End. Again the band''s name was absent from the front cover. It also marked the band''s inaugural artwork with design company Hipgnosis. The month after its release, Led Zeppelin opened at the Braves Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia on May 4, performing to over 49,000 people, the largest audience in that state''s history. The following day, Led Zeppelin''s concert at Tampa Stadium (now Houlihan''s Stadium), Florida, on May 5, broke the US box office record, previously held by The Beatles for their 1965 Shea Stadium appearance. 56,800 people attended grossing for the band US$309,000. For the first time and on subsequent US tours, the group avoided long trips to interstate venues by road, by leasing a full-sized Boeing 720B jet, nicknamed ''The Starship''. In-line with an expanded stage show, the band''s image also changed as members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing. In July 1973 a series of performances at New York''s Madison Square Garden was filmed for possible inclusion in a future movie. During the final night''s performance, US$203,000 of the band''s money from gate receipts went missing from a safety deposit box at the Drake Hotel. It was the single highest theft from a deposit box in Manhattan''s history and was never recovered. One million people saw their 34-date American tour, grossing over US$3 million. The band had begun on a project film during this tour and the extended 12 month break afterwards, at which time Robert Plant had minor vocal cord surgery and John Paul Jones considered leaving over the heavy touring schedule, but was persuaded to remain by Grant.</p>\r\nAs their five year deal with Atlantic Records was about to expire, on April 4, 1974 the band and their manager announced the launch their own Swan Song records label and secured a distribution deal via Atlantic, signing artists including Bad Company, The Pretty Things, Maggie Bell, Midnight Flyer, Dave Edmunds, Sad Café and Wildlife. Swan Song also assisted in sponsoring the production of Monty Python''s film The Holy Grail. The record label''s logo lettering used two stylised white swans, was set with a painting called Fall Of Day (1869) by William Rimmer, featuring a winged Apollo rising from the earth at sunset. Extravagant launch parties were thrown at Chislehurst Caves in Kent (October 31), at New York''s Four Seasons Hotel, and in Los Angeles and then, in March 1975, a lavish die-cut packaged double album was released entitled Physical Graffiti. Containing tracks stretching back to the start of the decade alongside new material recorded at Headley Grange, this again exhibited their eclectic abilities, containing many fine songs, particularly the eastern-inspired epic ''Kashmir'' and the funky ''Trampled Under Foot'', which climbed to No.38 in the US. At one point Physical Graffiti, which topped the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic, was selling at the rate of 500 copies per hour in one New York store alone, and on March 25 all six Led Zeppelin albums were on the Billboard Top 200 album charts. Led Zeppelin again toured the US in early 1975 and then in April, 51,000 tickets for three concerts at London''s Earls Court sold out in two hours. They ended up performing five four-hour shows there the following month accompanied by a display of laser beams, neon signs, coloured light show, dry ice, Ediphor screen and a 70,000 watt PA system not previously seen or heard on their previous UK tours.</p>\r\nBy now though, their monetary success was becoming almost counter-productive and in June they were forced into tax exile in Switzerland. After Earl''s Court, the band began a short overseas holiday with Page flying to Marrakesh to meet up with Plant, who travelled with his wife Maureen and family. Veering off the tourist paths, Page and Plant rented a Range Rover and drove deep into Morocco. The mission was to discover street music, and to soak up the experiences that might enhance the next album. They travelled through Ovazazatte, Zagora, Tagora, Tafraoute, the Atlas Mountains, moving north through Casablanca and Tangier with a schedule to meet up with the rest of the band in Montreux, Switzerland for rehearsals for a projected tour of the United States. While on the return journey Page detoured to visit southern Italy while Plant and his family continued the holiday in Greece. However, a serious car crash on a Greek island mountainside in which Robert Plant and his wife were badly injured on August 4, 1975, prevented any live appearances in the second half of the year. All tours were cancelled and Plant spent the rest of the year recuperating from his shattered elbow and ankle, first in the Channel Islands and then in Switzerland, as a result of that accident. Unable to return and stay at any length in the UK, the band reconvened in Malibu, California, where the forced hiatus allowed much of the material for their next album, Presence, to be composed. Presence was recorded within 18 days in November, at Musicland Studios in Munich, with Plant restricted to singing in a wheelchair, and again topped the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic on its release in April 1976. The sound gravitated towards more straightforward, guitar-based arrangements, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate keyboard work featured on their previous albums. Though it eventually did not sell as many units in total as the previous band releases, it contains two bona fide classics in the epic shapes of ''Nobody''s Fault but Mine'' and ''Achilles'' Last Stand''. Jimmy Page in later interviews has cited Presence as his favourite album. Their long-awaited film The Song Remains the Same was given a charity premiere at the Ritz Theatre in Manhattan on October 20, 1976, with proceeds going to the Save the Children Fund. Directed by Peter Clifton, it featured lengthy live footage alongside individual fantasy sequences: John Bonham raced a dragster, Robert Plant rescued a fair maiden, John Paul Jones appeared as a masked night rider, while Page climbed a Scottish mountain on the shores of Loch Ness in search of Father Time. A double soundtrack album featuring live versions of ''Rock and Roll'', ''Dazed and Confused'' and ''Stairway to Heaven'', was released the same month and predictably topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic, despite being far from the best recorded testament to their onstage talents circa 1973.</p>\r\n<p>Preparations began at Manticore Studios in January 1977, for their 11th tour of the US which started on April 1, at the Dallas Memorial Auditorium in Texas, and was slated to extend for forty-nine concerts across America, for an estimated 1.3 million ticket holders. Due to aircraft engine problems, The Starship was replaced by a Boeing 707 dubbed Caesar''s Chariot for all flights between cities. The tour included an extended acoustic set, and ''Battle of Evermore'' was performed for the first time live with John Paul Jones singing Sandy Denny''s original parts. The band played before a crowd of over 76,229 at the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan on April 30, breaking Led Zeppelin’s own attendance record set in 1973, followed by a six night stint at Madison Square Garden in June. Led Zeppelin were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for ''Outstanding Contribution to British Music'' on May 12, but by late 1977 despite continuing to win awards Led Zeppelin had lost ground in the media spotlight particularly in the UK having been unable to tour for over 2 years. Following a performance at the ''Day on the Green'' festival in Oakland, Plant was informed while in New Orleans of the tragic death of his 7-year-old son Karac on July 26 from a respiratory infection. Plant flew back to England in grief and the rest of the tour was cancelled which forced the band to take further unscheduled time off the road. Grant eventually persuaded Plant to rejoin the band, at a meeting at London''s Royal Garden Hotel in April 1978, and in May 1978, they had reunited to rehearse together at Clearwell Castle, in the Forest of Dean. They then played a pair of warm-up shows in Copenhagen, followed by their last UK dates (their first since 1975) which took place on August 4 and 11, 1979, when they attracted over 380,000 people to the Knebworth festivals in Hertfordshire, with a 23 song set.</p>\r\n<p>Their penultimate studio album, In Through the Out Door, was very different in style to its predecessors, being heavily influenced by Jones'' songwriting and use of synthesisers, and was recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm during December 1978. The standout tracks were ''In the Evening'', ''Carouselambra'', ''I''m Gonna Crawl'' and the balladic tribute to Plant''s son, ''All My Love''. The album was released packaged in a plain brown paper bag, with one of six different sleeves inside, and débuted at No.1 on the UK and US charts. As a result, Led Zeppelin''s entire catalogue made the Billboard Top 200 album chart between the weeks of October 27 and November 3, breaking the band''s similar previous feat in 1975. In December 1979, Jones, Bonham,and Plant all performed at a London benefit charity for the United Nations, Concert for the People of Kampuchea. The band picked up 8 awards at the annual Melody Maker Reader''s Poll in December before commencing rehearsals at The Rainbow Theatre in April, for a brief low-key European 14-day tour performing in Switzerland, Germany, Holland, Belgium, and Austria, undertaken in June and July 1980 with new tour manager Phil Carlo. The band adopted a playful and generous spirit about the tour, with Page even handling some of the stage introductions himself. Featuring a redolent back-to-basics set which opened with ''Train Kept a Rollin'''', and culminating at the Berlin Eissporthalle on July 7, 1980, where they concluded their set with a longer-than-usual version of ''Whole Lotta Love''. It was coincidently twelve years to the day after The Yardbirds'' (with Relf and McCarty) final performance. On September 24, 1980, Led Zeppelin met at Bray Studios to begin rehearsals for an upcoming 19-date North American tour, promoted as ''Led Zeppelin - The 80s: Part One'', which included new songs added to the set such as ''Carouselambra''. The band''s plan also included a return to the US West Coast in early 1981 and a UK tour in the spring, and the recording of a new, riff intense album. Their career was however brought to an abrupt finale when John Bonham accidentally asphyxiated in his sleep after a prolonged drinking session during rehearsals which ended at Page''s Old Mill House, Windsor property on September 25, 1980. Widely acclaimed as the greatest rock drummer ever, Bonham''s unique sound would have been difficult to replace and the remaining members, having met at London''s Savoy Hotel to discuss future plans, eventually announced the band''s dissolution and the cancellation of a US tour, on December 4, 1980: ''We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were.'' To fulfil contractual commitments, the remaining members of the band decided to drop the option of a chronologically ordered live anthology in favour of a career-spanning out-takes collection called Coda, which appeared in December 1982. It included two tracks taken from the band''s performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970, one each from the Led Zeppelin III and Houses of the Holy sessions, and three from the In Through the Out Door sessions. It also featured a 1976 John Bonham percussion instrumental with electronic embellishments added by Jimmy Page, called ''Bonzo''s Montreux''. With no longer a working band to promote, and Peter Grant in semi-retirement from the music industry, Swan Song Records was eventually wound up in late 1983.</p>\r\n<p>After the split, Plant, Page and Jones concentrated on developing their solo and production careers, though rumours of and actual reunions were never distant. In 1981, there were plans for both Page and Plant to team up with Alan White and Chris Squire of Yes to form XYZ (ex-Yes Zeppelin), but conflicting issues on who should manage the supergroup (Peter Grant or Brian Lane) and Plant''s decision not to proceed, ended the project prematurely after a number of demos were recorded. On July 13, 1985 the three remaining members of Led Zeppelin played a 20-minute set at the Philadelphia ''Live Aid'' benefit concert at JFK Stadium, but were under-rehearsed and plagued by a lack of foldback. Rehearsals for a projected reunion and world tour in January 1986, were cancelled after replacement drummer Tony Thompson broke his arm in a motorway accident on his way to Real World Studios, near Bath, on the second day. In 1988, Page also contributed to Plant''s Now and Zen track ''Tall Cool One'', which featured a medley of Led Zeppelin samples. There were also subsequent one-off reunions at the Atlantic Records'' 40th anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden (May 14, 1988), with Jason Bonham filling his father''s shoes on drums, and at Jason Bonham''s own wedding reception (April 28, 1990). On June 30, 1990, Page joined Plant onstage at Knebworth Park for the Silver Clef winners'' charity concert, performing ''Misty Mountain Hop'', ''Wearing and Tearing'', and ''Rock and Roll''.</p>\r\n<p>As producer, Page spent most of the 1990s remastering the entire Led Zeppelin back catalogue including the two volume Led Zeppelin Box Set and 3 disc Remasters set. The Box Set set also included four previously unreleased tracks, including the song ''Travelling Riverside Blues'', with an accompanying video resulting in heavy rotation on MTV. In 1991, a reunion was discussed to promote these new compilation releases, involving drummer Mike ''Puffy'' Bordin, but Plant was not ready to commit. Page and Plant participated in two invitation-only MTV Unplugged concerts on August 25 and 26, 1994. The success of the venture later prompted the pair to undertake a year-long world tour with a Middle Eastern orchestra, comprising 115 concerts, reinterpreting Led Zeppelin songs. Led Zeppelin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and received a Liftetime Achievement Award at the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello Awards in May 1997. After many years away from the public spotlight, former manager Peter Grant passed away on November 21, 1995. In 1998, Steve Albini produced an album of new Page-Plant compositions Walking Into Clarksdale, released with a low-fi production, to mixed reviews. Plant parted company with Page during 1999 to concentrate on his solo career, going back to his earlier R&B and West Coast roots. In October 1999, Page performed a series of shows with The Black Crowes recording a double album''s worth of Led Zeppelin covers. Page has never ruled out reforming Led Zeppelin.</p>\r\n<p>The RIAA announced on November 29, 1999 that the band were only the third act in music history to achieve four or more certified Diamond albums. VH1 named the group the #1 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock. A lavish four hour retrospective double DVD of Led Zeppelin was issued in 2003, and swiftly became the best-selling music DVD of all time. At the same time a triple live CD, How the West Was Won, a set recorded in 1972 that is superior in performance over The Song Remains the Same, was released. It opens with the powerful ''Immigrant Song'' and contains a superb 24-minute version of ''Whole Lotta Love'' and many other classics from their first three albums. In February 2005, Led Zeppelin received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and in 2006 was awarded the Polar Music Prize. Led Zeppelin was formally inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in September 2006. On December 10, 2007 the surviving members of Led Zeppelin reunited (along with former drummer John Bonham''s son Jason) for the Ahmet Ertegün charity tribute show at The O2 in London. The 16-song set was part of a benefit concert for the Ahmet Ertegun Education Fund, which provides scholarships for gifted children. According to Tixdaq, the Led Zeppelin reunion produced the highest average resale price (£707.97) for any concert ticket in 2007. Rumours persist of a future world tour, with millions of dollars from promoters on offer. Led Zeppelin became the first band inducted into the people''s choice Hall of Fame at WNCX in Cleveland, Ohio on March 3, 2008. In October 2008, John Paul Jones confirmed rumours that rehearsals had been held with Page and Jason Bonham with a new singer.</p>', '/images/artists/LedZeppelin.jpg'),
(23, 'Frank Zappa & Captain Beefheart', '<p><strong>Frank Zappa</strong></p><p>Composer, guitarist, singer, and bandleader Frank Zappa was a singular musical figure during a performing and recording career that lasted from the 1960s to the ''90s. His disparate influences included doo wop music and avant-garde classical music; although he led groups that could be called rock & roll bands for much of his career, he used them to create a hybrid style that bordered on jazz and complicated, modern serious music, sometimes inducing orchestras to play along. As if his music were not challenging enough, he overlay it with highly satirical and sometimes abstractly humorous lyrics and song titles that marked him as coming out of a provocative literary tradition that included Beat poets like Allen Ginsberg and edgy comedians like Lenny Bruce. Nominally, he was a popular musician, but his recordings rarely earned significant airplay or sales, yet he was able to gain control of his recorded work and issue it successfully through his own labels while also touring internationally, in part because of the respect he earned from a dedicated cult of fans and many serious musicians, and also because he was an articulate spokesman who promoted himself into a media star through extensive interviews he considered to be a part of his creative effort just like his music. The Mothers of Invention, the ''60s group he led, often seemed to offer a parody of popular music and the counterculture (although he affected long hair and jeans, Zappa was openly scornful of hippies and drug use). By the ''80s, he was testifying before Congress in opposition to censorship (and editing his testimony into one of his albums). But these comic and serious sides were complementary, not contradictory. In statement and in practice, Zappa was an iconoclastic defender of the freest possible expression of ideas. And most of all, he was a composer far more ambitious than any other rock musician of his time and most classical musicians, as well.</p><p><strong>Captian Beefheart</strong></p><p>Don Van Vliet (born Don Glen Vliet January 15, 1941) is an American musician and artist best known by the stage name Captain Beefheart. His musical work was conducted with a rotating ensemble of musicians called The Magic Band, active between 1965 and 1982, with whom he recorded 12 studio albums. Noted for his idiosyncratic singing voice with its wide range Van Vliet also occasionally played the harmonica, saxophone, bass clarinet, piccolo oboe, shehnai and keyboards. Often impossible to categorize, his music blended rock, blues and psychedelia with free jazz, avant-garde and contemporary experimental composition. An iconoclastic mix of shifting time signatures and complex rhythms, atonal melodies, jagged, dissonant guitar playing, and often humorously surreal lyrics it was crafted through his dictatorial control over his musicians and creative vision.</p><p>During his teen years in Lancaster, California, Van Vliet acquired an eclectic musical taste and formed "a mutually useful but volatile" friendship with Frank Zappa, with whom he sporadically competed and collaborated. He began performing with his Captain Beefheart persona in 1964 and joined the original Magic Band in 1965. The group drew attention and acclaim with their first album in 1967 on Buddah Records, Safe as Milk. After being dropped by two consecutive record labels, they signed to Frank Zappa''s newly formed Straight Records. Zappa as producer granted Beefheart the unrestrained artistic freedom to compose 1969''s Trout Mask Replica, ranked fifty-eighth in Rolling Stone magazine''s 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Frustrated with a lack of commercial success after seven studio albums, and fed up with Van Vliet''s temperamental and abusive nature, The Magic Band disbanded in 1974. A brief and critically panned flirtation with more conventional rock music resulted in two albums he later disowned. Beefheart then formed a new Magic Band with a group of younger musicians and regained contemporary prominence through three final albums (1978–82) that returned him to eccentricity.</p><p>Van Vliet has been described as "one of modern music''s true innovators" with "a singular body of work virtually unrivalled in its daring and fluid creativity". Although he achieved little mainstream success and received few critical accolades from those who often perceived him to have been wilfully unlistenable post-punk, experimental and alternative rock musicians.</p>', '/images/Large/BongoFury.jpg'),

(50, 'Metallica', '<p>Since their inception in 1981, Metallica have gone from an underground heavy-metal band to one of the most successful acts in the world, with an intensely loyal if not rabid fanbase. Their relevance is undeniable as evidenced by their ability to sell out stadiums and arenas worldwide while continuing to sell millions of albums with each release -- a feat no other band in history has sustained over a 25+ year career.</p><p>Sales of Metallica’s albums (including eight full-length albums and one e.p.) total over 97 million worldwide, and have earned gold and/or platinum certifications in over forty countries. Video/DVD sales for the band’s four long-form releases are over 6 million worldwide; the most for any rock band. In addition, a live box-set release (containing over eight hours of live music and video), retailing at over $80, has sold over 750,000 units worldwide, making it the biggest selling box-set of its kind in history. Their most recent studio album, “St. Anger”, with worldwide sales approaching 6 million, was #1 in 30 countries.</p><p>The band’s worldwide catalog sales over the last four years are second only to those of the Beatles. In each year from 2000 to 2006 the band’s catalog sold over 2.5 million albums worldwide. In 2004, the band’s catalog topped the 4 million mark. In an industry of fickle sales - where fan loyalty is on the brink of becoming a thing of the past - and where industry sales have plummeted by an estimated 30 to 40% Metallica are the most successful modern catalog band in the world; far outselling all rivals in all genres on a yearly basis.</p><p>On the broadcast front, Metallica remain the number 1 band in audience testing at all U.S. Rock radio formats (the number one for males aged 18-34) for the sixth straight year. According to the Demers Programming, “Metallica has accounted for approximately 5% of total airplay at the format over each of the past five years”. This feat is unprecedented.</p><p>Metallica have garnered numerous awards and accolades throughout the world over their career, including 6 Grammy Awards, 2 American Music Awards, 3 MTV Video Music Awards, 2 MTV Europe Video Music Awards, and over 30 California Music Awards. In addition, their 1991 album, "Metallica" has been awarded the prestigious "Diamond Award" from the Recording Industry Association of America (given to those albums with U.S. sales of 10 million or more). They received the ASCAP Founders Award, honoring them as songwriters (this award is unprecedented for a rock band).</p><p>When it comes to touring, there are few– if any– bands that deliver live the way Metallica does. Their shows, which began in clubs and garages in the early eighties, are now selling out in arenas and stadiums throughout the world, and continue to be among the most intense, powerful and visually stimulating concert experiences ever delivered. The band were the #1 concert draw in North America in the 1990’s, and have remained one of the five biggest touring acts in the world over the last fifteen years. The most impressive achievement that bears mentioning, however, is the fact that Metallica continue to be a strong attraction in the touring world; a truly rare feat in today’s mercurial entertainment business, where fans often change allegiance to bands as often as they do hairstyles. Their recent tour –the Summer ’07 “Sick of the Studio Tour”- which offered the band a brief respite from the recording of their new album, saw Metallica play twelve shows on the European continent to a total audience of nearly one million fans (including a headlining set at the London “LiveEARTH” show).</p><p>Metallica are a band whose success can be directly attributed to a passion and\r\nno-compromise attitude in every project they undertake.</p>', '/images/artists/Metallica.jpg');

(51, 'Queen', '<p>English rock band Queen were one of the most popular bands in the world, and have sold an estimated 300 million records internationally. Known for their theatrical style, and the flamboyant showmanship of lead singer Freddie Mercury, the band built a reputation through the 1970s with million-selling albums and emphatic live performances.</p><p>Their breakthrough was the 1974 album Queen II, which hit No.5 in the British charts and included a Top 10 single, Seven Seas of Rhye. Third album Sheer Heart Attack (1974) was the first Queen record to win over critics as well as fans, and is often regarded as their first true classic. They embarked on a world tour and won the hearts of every crowd they played to.</p><p>A Night at the Opera (1975) was, at the time, the most expensive album ever recorded, but it proved to be worth the cost. It spent more than a year in both the UK and US charts, eventually selling over three million copies in the US. A Night at the Opera is often regarded as Queen''s magnum opus, and features on many critics'' lists of great albums. It also featured their signature song, "Bohemian Rhapsody", which topped the UK charts for nine weeks and is one of Britain''s biggest-selling singles ever. It is also regularly voted as one of the greatest singles ever, and its video is considered to be a landmark in the history of music promotion - after "Bohemian Rhapsody", every band demanded videos for their singles.</p><p>Now one of the biggest bands in the world, Queen continued to enjoy incredible commercial success with A Day At The Races (1976) and News Of The World (1977), containing the massive hits "Somebody to Love", "We Will Rock You" and "We are the Champions". In 1976 they performed a free concert in Hyde Park, London, in front of a crowd estimated at close to 200,000. 1978''s Jazz was an eclectic album that went nowhere near jazz, while the band achieved their first US No.1s at the turn of the decade with "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" and "Another one Bites the Dust".</p><p>The band continued to tour in stadiums and set attendance records on a South American tour, playing to hundreds-of-thousands of fans every night. "Under Pressure" (with David Bowie) was another huge hit, as were "Radio Ga Ga" and "I Want to Break Free". 1985 was a pivotal year for the band: they broke more attendance records by twice performing in front of 325,000 fans in Rio, before their blockbusting set at Live Aid. Watched by a worldwide TV audience of over a billion, it was recently voted ''The Greatest Live Performance Ever'' by a BBC poll. In 1988 Queen stopped performing live and concentrated on their studio work, which continued to yield million-selling albums.</p><p>By 1988 rumours were beginning to circulate that Mercury was suffering from AIDS. The rumours were consistently denied, but in 1991 Mercury issued a statement admitting that it was true. He died the next day, at the age of 45.</p><p>The following year a massive fundraising concert took place in Mercury''s memory, featuring stars like Bowie, Robert Plant, Elton John, Guns n'' Roses and Metallica. It was broadcast to over a billion viewers worldwide and raised over £20 million for AIDS charities. Later, "Bohemian Rhapsody" was featured prominently in the film Wayne''s World, leading to a renaissance in the song''s popularity among a new generation of fans. An album called Made in Heaven was released in 1995 comprising finished versions of tracks started with Mercury in the studio several years earlier. In 2005, guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor commenced touring again with Paul Rodgers, known together as Queen + Paul Rodgers so as to avoid the impression that Mercury was being replaced by Rodgers. As everyone who has seen a Queen performance from the 70s or 80s knows, Freddie Mercury is simply irreplaceable.</p>', '/images/artists/queen.jpg'),
(52, 'Kiss', '<p>KISS is an American rock band known for their distinctive face paint and outfits, hard hitting rock ''n'' roll style and lavish stage shows which include fire breathing, pyrotechnics, exploding guitars and fireworks. With a mix of songs about women and the rock ''n'' roll lifestyle, and stage shows that are highly energetic and theatrical, the band won over legions of fans primed to party.</p><p>KISS released almost 20 studio albums, and all four members released a solo album on the same day in a similar KISS style (these are also usually considered to be KISS albums). KISS have sold almost 100 million albums, performed countless sold-out stadium tours, and used their distinctive style to launch many successful lines of band merchandise.</p><p>The band''s breakthrough was 1975''s live album Alive!, which stayed in the American charts for more than two years, and sold over four million copies. Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over and Love Gun were all million-sellers as KISS became one of America''s most popular bands. They also began to sell all kinds of KISS-related merchandise, including comic books featuring the band members, dolls, make-up kits and board games. They''ve lent their likeness to 3000+ items including condoms and caskets.</p><p>However, the plan to release four simultaneous solo albums backfired as fans could not afford to purchase all four. They each sold poorly and KISS slowly went into a decline. In 1978, KISS starred in their own TV movie, but it was universally panned. It seemed as though KISS had run their course, but the world underestimated KISS.</p><p>Despite tensions increasing within the band, which lead to Peter Criss and Ace Frehley''s departure, remaining founding members Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley added a new drummer and guitarist and continued to tour to large crowds and sell reasonably well. In 1983, the band took off their costumes and make-up and appeared as a ''normal'' rock band for the first time.</p><p>With their makeup and costumes, they took on the personas of comic book-style characters: Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and Catman (Criss). The band explains that the fans were the ones who ultimately chose their makeup designs. Paul Stanley became the "Starchild" because of his tendency to be referred to as the "starry-eyed lover" and "hopeless romantic." The "Demon" makeup reflected Simmons'' cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Ace Frehley''s "Spaceman" makeup was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction and supposedly being from another planet. Peter Criss'' "Catman" makeup was in accordance with the belief that Criss had nine lives because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn.</p><p>The album Lick It Up, released in 1983 with Criss and Frehley''s replacements, was KISS'' best-selling in three years, but fewer people were attending their live shows, indicating that the theatricality was what fans enjoyed most. The band continued to struggle through the 1980s, and were devastated when drummer Eric Carr died in 1991, after battling cancer.</p><p>In the mid-90s there was a minor KISS revival, thanks in part to nostalgia for the bands'' heydey in the 1970s. Yet in 1996 at the Grammy Awards, KISS made a shock comeback, with full make-up and costumes, supported briefly by original bandmates Criss and Frehley. They went back out on the road and the resulting KISS Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. They released two more studio albums, although the connection with Criss and Frehley did not last.</p><p>Internal conflicts again began to arise in the early 2000''s leading to Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer taking over drumming and guitar duties respectively.</p><p>The band put out a new studio album, Sonic Boom, in 2009 which debuted at No. 2 on the Top 100 album charts. The band undertook a tour to celebrate 35 Years of the band, and to support the new album, called the <p>"Alive/35" tour and a new studio album is expected in 2011.</p>', '/images/artists/kiss-band.jpg'),

The membership of Purple has included some of the most respected members of heavy rock''s hall of fame, though Ian Paice is the only original member still with the band.</p><p>The original band was named Roundabout and the founder members were Chris Curtis (whose idea the band was), Jon Lord, Ritchie Blackmore, Rod Evans, Ian Paice and Nick Simper. They changed their name to Deep Purple before they had their first hit in America, "Hush", from their debut album, Shades of Deep Purple. The two follow-up albums were Book of Taliesyn and the self-titled Deep Purple.</p><p>Three albums into their career their American record company folded. Deep Purple returned to Britain and fired Evans and Simper, recruiting Ian Gillan and Roger Glover to replace them. This line-up is still regarded as the classic Purple line-up. After a brief detour to record Concerto for Group and Orchestra the band returned to its hard rocking roots. The result was Deep Purple in Rock, the first of several classic releases from the band, containing the tracks "Speed King" and "Child in Time". Not included on the album but recorded at the same time, was the hit single "Black Night". It was followed by Fireball and finally, Machine Head, one of their most famous albums which contained the key tracks "Smoke on the Water", "Highway Star", "Space Trucking" and "Lazy".</p><p>By this time inner tensions were beginning to fracture the harmony and by 1973''s Who Do We Think We Are, Gillan and Glover were gone, replaced by David Coverdale and Glen Hughes. They released two albums Burn and Stormbringer, but Blackmore wasn''t happy and in 1975 he left to form Rainbow.</p><p>Tommy Bolin was Blackmore''s replacement and together they recorded Come Taste the Band, which marked a stylistic change to a funkier rock groove. But Bolin had substance abuse problems which caused problems within the band, leading to poor live performances and cancelled shows and, in 1976, David Coverdale could take no more and left, preceding the official break up of the band by months. Bolin was dead before the year was out; he had overdosed on drugs.</p><p>The various members of the fractured band went on to find success with other bands including Whitesnake, Black Sabbath and Gillan. Attempts were made to resuscitate Deep Purple, but nothing significant arose for eight years. In 1984 the classic line-up (Blackmore, Gillan, Glover, Lord and Paice) announced they would be reforming and quickly released Perfect Strangers. Unfortunately, after 1986''s The House of Blue Light, a tour, and an album of the tour Nobody''s Perfect (1988), relationships soured once more and in 1989 Gillan was sacked again. Joe Lynn Turner joined Purple for just one album, 1990''s Slaves and Masters, but fan stalwarts, Lord, Paice and Glover, all wanted to see Gillan back in the fold. He agreed to return and they all recorded The Battle Rages On, but the primary tension between Blackmore and Gillan was such that Blackmore eventually walked out.

(81, 'Eric Clapton', '<p>Eric Clapton is widely considered one of the greatest blues guitarists of all time. He played with The Yardbirds, a seminal 60s blues-rock band that would go on to become Led Zeppelin, before recording an album that is known as one of the greatest blues-rock albums ever made, with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers. He went on to form three supergroups in quick succession -- Cream, Blind Faith, and Derek and the Dominos -- before embarking on a hugely successful solo career.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClapton joined The Yardbirds in 1963 and quickly developed a big reputation for his guitar ability and style. In 1965 he joined Mayall''s band, and their album of the following year Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton is widely hailed as a classic of its style. A famous photograph of a piece of London graffiti summed up the reaction of fans: it read ''Clapton Is God''. In 1966 he formed Cream with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker. For the two-and-a-bit years that they existed, Cream were a massive worldwide success, selling out tours wherever they went and selling millions of albums. Clapton developed as a songwriter for classic records such as Disraeli Gears (1967) and Wheels of Fire (1968), both of which were inspirational to Led Zeppelin and the other hard rock and metal acts that followed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter Cream broke up in 1968, Clapton''s next project was Blind Faith, formed with Baker, Steve Winwood and Rick Grech. They toured to massive crowds and released one self-titled album, before splitting. Clapton released an eponymous solo album and spent 1970 guesting on albums by others, including All Things Must Pass by close friend George Harrison. He then formed Derek and the Dominos, and released Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. It was met with a mixed reception but has since been reappraised as a classic. It features the lead single ''Layla'', which includes one of the most famous guitar riffs ever written.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring this period Clapton declined into depression, worsened by a serious heroin habit, the deaths of close friend Jimi Hendrix and band-mate Duane Allman, and the poor initial response to the Layla album. Derek and the Dominos gave up halfway through recording a second album, and Clapton retreated from public view. He only came out to perform at Harrison''s 1971 Concert for Bangladesh (during which he passed out on-stage), before The Who''s Pete Townshend organised a comeback gig for him, later released as the Rainbow Concert (1973). His first album after kicking the heroin habit, 461 Ocean Boulevard (1974), was a big hit with critics and the public, and included a hit cover of Bob Marley''s ''I Shot the Sheriff''. Subsequent albums were low-key, but Slowhand (1977) featured two big singles: ''Wonderful Tonight'' and ''Cocaine''.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1992, there was a re-emergence in Clapton''s commercial fortunes, brought about by deep personal tragedy. His four year old son Conor died after falling out of a high-rise window in New York. The sorrowful song Clapton wrote about it, ''Tears in Heaven'', was a worldwide smash, and won three Grammy Awards. It was released on the Rush soundtrack and also included on the Unplugged live album, which was widely acclaimed.</p>', '/images/artists/Clapton.jpg'),

Unstoppable throughout the decade that followed, Maiden recorded and toured relentlessly with seven new studio albums and seven World Tours in the ‘80s alone , cementing their reputation as the hardest-working band on the planet and further strengthening a unique identity and remarkable relationship with their fans.</p>\r\n<p>With the unmistakable figure of band mascot Eddie adorning every album cover, T-shirt and backdrop, Iron Maiden created a world of their own; one that welcomed fans from every culture, creed and social sphere with a guarantee of heartfelt conviction and unprecedented professionalism.\r\nA five-piece band for the first 20 years of their career, in 1999 Iron Maiden became a six-piece, and established the ultimate Iron Maiden line-up of Bruce Dickinson on vocals, Steve Harris on bass, Nicko McBrain on drums and “the three amigos” – Adrian Smith, Dave Murray and Janick Gers - on guitar. This line-up has scaled breath-taking new heights and become increasingly fearless and boldly creative since the release of the Brave New World album in 2000.</p>\r\n<p>With both 2003’s diverse and ingenious Dance Of Death album and its dark and daring follow-up, 2006’s A Matter Of Life And Death, they dazzled fans and critics alike. With each successive tour, whether revisiting classic songs from their first few albums or playing A Matter Of Life And Death in its entirety, Maiden accrued countless new admirers, momentum building all the while.</p>\r\n<p>This brave new Maiden era reached an astonishing zenith during the band’s Somewhere Back In Time Tour that began in February 2008 and initially took the band 50,000 miles around the world in 45 days, flying in their own specially chartered Boeing 757, Ed Force One, piloted by Bruce Dickinson, a qualified airline captain, traversing the planet, from India to Costa Rica, Australia to Argentina, Sao Paolo to Tokyo. Along with tours of Europe and North America, the Somewhere Back In Time tour saw Maiden play 89 concerts in front of two million fans in 38 countries on five Continents, forging new relationships with countries they had never performed in before and strengthening ties with nations that had long been part of Maiden’s global family. This unique undertaking was celebrated in 2009’s widely praised, award-winning Flight 666 movie, and subsequent DVD release which topped the music DVD charts in 25 countries.</p>\r\n<p>Proudly refusing to take their collective foot from the accelerator, and picking up their first ever Brit Award along the way for Best British Live Act 2009, Iron Maiden are now back with a brand new studio album, just over a year on from the end of that mammoth tour. The Final Frontier is the band’s 15th album in 30 years and it is plainly one of the strongest and most wildly inventive things they have ever produced; a 76-minute tour-de-force of soaring melodies, thunderous heaviness and astonishing compositional bravery it looks certain to be regarded as a new landmark in the band’s career.</p>', '/images/artists/ironmaiden.jpg'),

Downing and Ian Hill. They were approached by Al Atkins, the singer of a defunct band called Judas Priest, and he asked if they would like to form a band using the Judas Priest name. The new band toured around the local area refining their sound until it developed its characteristic heavy metal thud, and though they lost Atkins along the way they picked up Rob Halford as their new singer. By 1974 they released their debut album, Rocka Rolla, having added a second guitarist, Glen Tipton, to round out their sound.</p><p>They released a further four albums in the 1970s, and by the start of the next decade their following was such that their 1980 release British Steel achieved platinum status and hit the Top 5 of the British album charts. Several of the album tracks found airplay on the radio, including "United", "Breaking the Law" and "Living After Midnight". Though the next album Point of Entry (1981) did not fare as well, achieving only gold certification, Screaming for Vengeance (1982) went double platinum in America. This marked their commercial zenith as their seven subsequent albums failed to reach this high point, though they did experiment with different sounds to keep fresh.</p><p>Halford left the band in the early 90s and was replaced by Tim "Ripper" Owens, but he returned in 2005 for Angel of Retribution.

(105, 'Men At Work', '<p>Hailing from the Land Down Under, Men at Work began their reggae-inspired rock ‘n’ roll career in Melbourne, Australia, in the late 1970s. Within a year after their debut release, their success spread to the United States and around world when Business As Usual topped the charts in several countries. In 1986 the members went their separate ways, and some pursued solo careers. They reformed ten years later, touring South America and selected cities in the United States. Band members Greg Ham, John Rees, Jerry Speiser, and Ron Strykert are all originally from Australia. Singer Colin Hay, originally from Scotland, moved to Australia at the age of 14. Each member individually began his music career in the pubs and clubs of Melbourne. Ham, Speiser, Strykert, and Hay had informally jammed together at the Grace Darling Hotel in Melbourne and decided to form Men at Work.</p><p>The quartet played at the Cricketers Arms Hotel in Melbourne for a couple of months. Then, they recruited bassist John Rees. "It was great to find musicians who were so into what they were doing," Rees told Kurt Loder in Rolling Stone." It was exciting music. There was something happening." Men at Work played every Thursday night at the hotel for over a year to evergrowing audiences. By 1980 the word about Men at Work’s performances had spread around town, and they could sell out almost any venue in Melbourne without ever having been played on the radio.</p><p>The following year, the band got the attention of CBS Records Australia, which signed them to a record contract. The label introduced them to Los Angeles-based producer Peter Mclan, who was in Australia recording an album with New Zealand pop singer Sharon O’Neill. Mclan produced Men at Work’s debut album Business As Usual, which included the songs "Who Can It Be Now?," "Be Good Johnny," and "Down Under." Both the album and the first single "Who Can It Be Now?" quickly reached number one on the Australian charts.</p><p>"We were around at the right time for Australian music," Ham told David Fricke in Rolling Stone in 1982. "If we’d been doing this six or seven years ago, we might never have surfaced out of Melbourne." It turned out that Men at Work’s timing was right for many more countries than just Australia. In the United States, MTV had begun to expose bands that radio had ignored, which helped lead Men at Work to success even beyond their American record company’s expectations.</p><p>At first, CBS Records in the United States did not want to release Business As Usual despite the album’s Australian success. Men at Work’s Australian label representative wouldn’t take "no" for an answer from his American counterparts, and complained to Dick Asher, then president of CBS Records’ domestic division. At Asher’s request, AI Teller, then head of Columbia Records in New York (a division of CBS), agreed to release the band’s debut without listening to it first. The record executives at Columbia were stunned when Men at Work became a runaway success in the United States.</p><p>In 1982 the band traveled to the United States to open for Fleetwood Mac on that group’s tour. Soon after, "Who Can It Be Now?" made its way to the top of the American charts. Both the single and Business As Usual stayed at number one on Billboard’s charts for 15 weeks. "The MTV connection cannot be over-stressed," Kurt Loder wrote in Rolling Stone." Men at Work weren’t simply another group with a record out, they were an audio-visual package—essentially a new commodity in what was quickly becoming a whole new music-marketing ball game." During two straight weeks in 1983, Business As Usual and "Down Under" were the number one album and single, respectively, in both the United States and Britain. At that time, the only other artists to have achieved that landmark were The Beatles, Rod Stewart, and Simon and Garfunkel.</p><p>That same year, Men at Work won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. They immediately returned to the studio to record their follow-up effort, Cargo, which was also produced by Mclan. Cargo included the singles "Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive," "Overkill," and "It’s a Mistake." After the release, the band toured twice in the United States and Canada and performed in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe, Australia, and Japan. In the summer of 1983, the group played at the US Festival in front of 300, 000 people. The concert, which took place in California, was broadcast live all over the United States and via satellite to Russia. The speed of their success and the growing audiences at their concerts only fueled Men at Work’s ambition." We have very strong ideas about our destiny," Hay told David Fricke in Rolling Stone." We really believe in what we have to offer. If you put an audience in front of us, we’ll win them."</p><p>In 1984 Men at Work took a break. Rees and Speiser left the band, and the remaining members decided not to replace them. Hay used his time off to produce an album for a friend’s band, and Ham performed in an R&B band with his girlfriend. Hay, Ham, and Stryker regrouped in 1985 to release Two Hearts. The album reached gold sales status in the United States but did not produce a hit single. Ralph Novak wrote in his People review," With the departure of bassist John Rees and drummer Jerry Speiser, Men at Work has succumbed to a kind of manpower shortage that doesn’t help the Australian group’s first album in two years."</p><p>The group followed up Two Hearts with a tour that included the United States, Australia, Japan, Europe, and the Caribbean. Their total record sales at the time had reached more than 12 million albums. With their greatest success behind them, the band members decided to call it quits. Hay and Ham pursued their respective solo careers. Hay released five solo albums between 1986 and 2000. Every once in a while, Ham would appear at some of Hay’s shows, and the two members would showcase a couple of Men at Work songs.</p><p>Men at Work released several compilation albums during the late 1990s and in 2000, including 1995’s Puttin’ in Overtime,1996’s Contraband—The Best of Men at Work, and Super Hits in 2000. In 1996, Hay and Ham reunited for a tour of South America and a few shows in the United States, a teaming they repeated in 1997. The following year, they released a live album called Brazil, which they recorded live in São Paulo. The album also included a new studio recording called "The Longest Night."</p><p>Though their rise to the top was fast, Men at Work continued to labor over their music, whether it was recording and touring together or on their own projects. Their success opened the door for many other Australian bands to make their mark during the 1980s. Their persistence led them from being a pub band in Melbourne to a worldwide sensation.</p>', '/images/artists/placeholder.gif'),
(106, 'Motörhead', '<p>Melody Maker once described the British band Motörhead as "the genuine pared-down, no-frills bare bones of skull-smashing music." The group’s sound has been streamlined somewhat since its formation in 1975, but despite personnel changes and an existence mostly at the margins of commercial hard rock, Motörhead has survived to earn a degree of respect from critics and even some non-metal fans. Merging the anarchic roar and speed of punk rock with the musical and thematic concerns of metal, the group helped to pioneer what has become known as "speed metal" and "thrash," influencing countless bands in the ensuing years but outlasting most of its competition. The distinctive rasp of bassist-leader Lemmy Kilmister remains one of the rawest sounds in rock. According to Jon Blackmore of Melody Maker, when Lemmy set his sights on ’70s rock, "[he] almost single-handedly kicked it off its platform boots, ripped away its indulgent preening, and invested it with a punk ethic and raucous venom that’s seen it chug happily into the ’80s [and beyond], along with a list of Motörhead imitators too long to contemplate."</p><p>Kilmister, who has since become simply Lemmy, had played for the group Hawkwind but left to form his own outfit—originally called Bastard—in 1975. With guitarist Larry Wallis and drummer Lucas Fox, the trio signed a deal with United Artists Records. Unfortunately, the album they recorded was not released for five years. The band floated for a while, pursuing a project with Stiff Records impresario Jake Riviera that also stalled. "Everyone was against us. We couldn’t even get a gig at one time," Lemmy told Melody Maker. "Ina way, the music business made us what we are: It forced us into being something that didn’t give a shit. It tried to push us out, and very nearly succeeded. It stopped us working."</p><p>Wallis and Fox departed in 1978 and were replaced by "Fast" Eddie Clarke on guitar and Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor on drums, with whom the band would make its early reputation. The group then recorded a self-titled LP for Chiswick Records in the U.K. The album fared well, making it into the British Top Fifty. Thanks in part to Howard Thompson, a record executive and Motorhead fan, the band then moved on to Bronze Records, a bigger label, and in 1978 released a version of the rock standard "Louie Louie"—which resulted in a chart hit— and their sophomore effort, Bomber; this was followed by Overkill, in 1979. On Parole, the earlier effort recorded with Wallis and Fox, was finally released on the United Artists label in 1980.</p><p>It was Ace of Spades, however, Motörhead’s other 1980 release, that made the band an international contender in the world of hard rock. American fans were taken by the group’s blazing approach; the title track was particularly popular. Motörhead’s logo—a ferocious-looking fanged skull—became the t-shirt design of choice for many young headbangers. The 1981 follow-up, No Sleep Til Hammersmith, made it to the top of the British album charts. Rolling Stone identified the band in a review of the 1982 album Iron Fist as an example of the trend in metal "toward a visceral directness that prefers punch over flash." Indeed, wrote J. D. Considine, "The British trio plays with a brutish intensity that makes [Australian hard rockers] AC/DC seem like [the easy-listening pop group] Air Supply. Granted, rock & roll as sonic shrapnel is a rather limited perspective, but Motorhead offsets the music’s relent-lessness with surprisingly astute lyrics and exhilarating bursts of manic guitar. This is music for the thinking headbanger."</p><p>1982 also saw the departure of Eddie Clarke. He was replaced by axeman Brian Robertson, formerly of the influential British group Thin Lizzy. In 1983 Motorhead released the records What’s Words Worth and Another Perfect Day. Of the latter, Melody Maker’s Adam Sweeting commented, "Where records like ’Ace of Spades’ or ’Iron Fist’ were a bit like being struck by one of those things they use to knock down buildings, ’Day’ is sort of spacier, kinda wider-ranging. Much of this must be attributed to Robinson, a one-man guitar army who loves nothing better than to hole up in a studio and pile on layer after layer of guitars." As drummer Taylor observed in the same article, "Before, our records were like being punched in the teeth. Now it’s like being punched in the teeth with an apology afterwards."</p><p>Apologies notwithstanding, more personnel changes ensued. In 1984 Taylor took what the band, in a Melody Maker notice, called "a long overdue rest." He was replaced by Pete Gill, late of the band Saxon. Robertson also departed, leaving Lemmy to choose between two possible replacements: Welsh guitarist Phil "Zoom" Campbell and another player known only as Wurzel. Instead of wrestling with this important decision, Lemmy hired both. Quotes from the two in Melody Maker suggested that they were undaunted by their new assignment: "It’s great to be back on the folk circuit," quipped Campbell, while Wurzel claimed, "[Motörhead is] my granny’s favorite band."</p><p>Meanwhile, 1984 saw the release of the compilation No Remorse; it featured 22 songs culled from the group’s previous records. The new lineup’s first LP together was 1986’s Orgasmatron; Blackmore of Melody Maker called it "a raging orgy of noise with lyrics that would make the flesh crawl off your back." In 1987 Taylor returned to the drumkit, and the group recorded the album Rock ’N’Roll. The following year saw the release of the live collection No Sleep At All.</p><p>Having signed with Epic Records label WTG, Motörhead toured regularly but seemed destined to remain on the fringe of the metal scene they had done so much to shape. Their first album for WTG, 1916, garnered rave reviews, however. "Its fast songs serve as textbook examples of how to rock," wrote Stereo Review’s Parke Puterbaugh, adding that the 1991 album’s more conceptual pieces "plunge into the heart of darkness with unnerving power." Jim Farber of Rolling Stone affirmed, "On 1916 Motörhead manages to mingle ruthlessness and listenability like never before." And Janiss Garza, writing for Rip, called the album "a creative triumph." The record sold an impressive 500,000 units, and the band—which spent part of the year with Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, and Metal Church on the Operation Rock & Roll Tour—earned a Grammy nomination for best hard rock/heavy metal performance.</p><p>Working with producer Pete Solley, who oversaw 1916, Motörhead returned to the studio the following year. But while the band was recording, Taylor again proffered his resignation—this time apparently for good—and the remaining members recruited former Dokken drummer Mikkey Dee to replace him. The result was 1992’s March or Die. Featuring metal megastar Ozzy Osbourne singing with Lemmy on the ballad "I Ain’t No Nice Guy," guest guitar work by Slash of Guns N’ Roses, and a furious cover of Motor City Madman Ted Nugent’s raunch-rock classic "Cat Scratch Fever," March or Die represented a further streamlining of the Motörhead sound.</p><p>Reviews were once again generally favorable, though Lorraine Ali of Spin sniffed that the effort was merely the group’s "most inoffensive." Garza, writing this time for Entertainment Weekly, awarded March or Die an "A" and insisted that it "surges way beyond the confines of ordinary heavy metal." 1992 also saw Motörhead take part in the massive Guns N’ Roses/Metallica tour, contribute two songs to the Hellraiser III movie soundtrack, and become the first band of its kind to appear on The Tonight Show. Lemmy branched out, writing the smash hit "Mama I’m Coming Home" for Osboume and some songs for metal chanteuse Lita Ford. Jailbait, a live "authorized bootleg" from Motörhead’s Iron Fist tour, appeared on Receiver Records that year as well.</p><p>Toiling on the periphery for so many years while younger bands reaped fame and fortune may have galled Lemmy and the rest of Motörhead, but they have proved that sticking to one’s vision can pay off. Their admirers nonetheless remain indignant: "Out of all the bands that have influenced the history of hard rock," lamented Garza in her Rip profile, "these guys probably have the least to show for their efforts. When they should be headlining packed arenas, they’re still struggling for a good middle slot." As if to underscore Garza’s contention, Epic dropped the band in 1993.</p><p>Still, despite the understandable "bitterness" that some have attributed to Lemmy, he and his mates have soldiered on, convinced that performing is its own reward. Asked by Pulse! to define his favorite audience, Lemmy referred glowingly to "the feedback, hands punching only the air, people knowing the words and singing along, girls showing off at the front, people at the side of the stage jumping up and down and smiling." For the Motörhead faithful, the "kick in the teeth" provided by the band’s relentless energy requires no apology.</p>', '/images/artists/Motorhead.jpg'),
(109, 'Mötley Crüe', '<p>Mötley Crüe’s loud, irreverent, and hard-driving heavy metal music has drawn sneers from rock critics and nothing short of adulation from millions of teenaged fans. The songs, both in sound and substance, are precisely calculated to echo the aggressions and sexual fantasies of alienated younger Americans—and are just as precisely calculated to disturb parents and other adult authority figures. The members of Mötley Crüe do more than just preach a musical ethic of parties, fast women, and immediate self-satisfaction, they have lived those values, a phenomenon that is no small part of their appeal. After 20 years, significant personnel changes, five multiplatinum albums, and more than 40 million records sold, Mötley Crüe continue to bring their mix of what Rolling Stone online called "heavy metal, glampop, Top 40 and alternative grunge" to audiences.</p><p>As David Handelman noted in Rolling Stone in 1987, heavy metal of the Mötley Crüe variety "caught on as a sort of Lite punk: it smells and tastes like rebellion but without that political aftertaste. Its main selling points are that adults find it unlistenable, preachers call it blasphemous, and Tipper Gore blushes reading the lyrics. Fans at Crüe concerts say they like the group because the music is hard and fast, but they also like the band’s reckless hedonism, which they read about in the metal fanzines." That hedonism became legend for the band: two Crüe members, Tommy Lee and Nikki Sixx, married starlets and were arrested for instigating a riot in 1997, singer Vince Neil was convicted of felony manslaughter for a drunk driving accident, and Sixx was a heroin addict during much of the band’s early days. "I’ve always thought of us as the psychiatrists of rock & roll," Sixx told Rolling Stone, "because the kids come to see us get all this anxiety and pent-up aggression out. That hour and a half is theirs. No one can take it away. No parent can tell them to turn it down."</p><p>The original members of Mötley Crüe—Lee, Mars, Neil, and Sixx—are high school dropouts who displayed rebellious tendencies in early youth. They met in California in the early 1980s after each had worked some time in various heavy metal club bands. Nikki Sixx was the founder of the group, originally called Christmas, but the band’s name comes from the imagination of guitarist Mick Mars. Handelman recounts that Sixx and Lee recruited Mars after seeing his ad: "LOUD, RUDE, AGGRESSIVE GUITARIST AVAILABLE." Handelman quotes Lee as saying, "We didn’t even have to hear him play. We went, ‘This is the guy—he’s disgusting.’" The band was rounded out with singer Vince Neil, whose onstage theatrics were more valuable than his vocal prowess.</p><p>By 1983 Mötley Crüe was a favorite new band among heavy metal aficionados. Handelman noted in 1987 that the Crüe had "consumed more than 750 bottles of Jack Daniel’s in its quest for musical excellence." In 1983 Sixx was quoted as saying: "We could just fall apart tomorrow or go straight to the top, because we’re such extremists as personalities. It’s like riding a roller coaster twenty-four hours a day. Every time you turn around, somebody’s in jail or 100,000 kids are buying our album."</p><p>As with many heavy metal bands of the 1980s, Mötley Crüe was helped immensely by the advent of cable television’s MTV. The band’s graphic music videos delighted teens and enraged would-be adult censors such as Tipper Gore, wife of then Senator Al Gore. The adult antipathy to Crüe’s style only intensified the appeal for some teens; what surprised Crüe, and many other observers, was the age of the audience. Fan letters from ten- and eleven-year-olds were not uncommon, and the average age of a Mötley Crüe fan was 15. "We play and write for the kids," Sixx told Rolling Stone in 1987. "We’ve never had peer acceptance. They couldn’t see past the costumes…. Kids don’t buy Whitney Houston. People that buy one record a year buy that. In the golden age of rock it was all kids playing for kids. Now it’s that again." Neil added: "We don’t write songs to be messages…. When I was younger, even now, I don’t listen to the words. If I like the melody, I like the song."</p><p>In Esquire magazine in 1984, Bob Greene polled some Crue fans for ideas on the source of the group’s attraction. One 19-year-old girl replied: "I think they’re all gorgeous. When I see them, I just naturally think of leather and whips and chains. I think that means that they’re aggressive. I happen to love that image; it’s a neat image. I think it’s that kind of aggressiveness that a woman is always looking for." A 13-year-old female fan put it even more succinctly. "They’re really good-looking," she said. "Good and mean. They just look like guys who are out to party and have a good time."</p><p>Admittedly, Mötley Crüe music is not strong on lyrics. Most songs deal with the band, touring, male exploits with buddies or women, and parties. The tunes are classic hard rock, with insistent drum beats and catchy guitar riffs. What has made Mötley Crüe famous, however, is its road shows, which are often filled with special effects, racy leather clothing, and macho antics, all delivered at the peak of amplification. "We try to go overboard with the stage show," Neil told Handel-man, "so the kids get their money’s worth. I’d be bummed if I went to a concert and they just stood there and played. That’s not my idea of show business." Handelman commented that the music "stirs the kids up only to dump them back in the malls, as exhausted and aimless as ever."</p><p>Mötley Crüe has managed to keep making music despite significant personnel changes. Neil left the group in a much-publicized dismissal in February of 1992 because his bandmates felt he "didn’t share their determination and passion for music," according to Craig Rosen of Billboard; he was replaced by John Corabi, formerly of The Scream. Neil embarked on a solo career in 1993 and established the Vince Neil Band, but returned to Mötley Crüe in September of 1996, displacing Corabi as lead singer. Corabi filed suit against the group for monies owed to him in 1997. Sixx has remained a part of Mötley Crüe but started a side project in 1998, called 58. Lee left Mötley Crüe in 1999 to form his own rap-metal band, Methods of Mayhem; he was replaced by former Ozzy Osbourne drummer Randy Castillo.</p><p>Following a string of highly successful releases during the early-to mid-1980s, which included Theatre of Pain and Girls, Girls, Girls, Mötley Crüe’s most successful release was Dr. Feelgood in 1989, an album which followed the group’s 1988 stint in rehab. Mötley Crüe followed in 1994 with Corabi as lead singer. The reviews of Corabi’s debut were not glowing; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of All Music Guide called him a "hoarse shouter without the charisma of Vince Neil." Neil’s return to the group in 1996 inspired the release of the reunion album Generation Swine in 1997 and a subsequent North American tour. The group left Elektra in 1998 with rights to its full recording catalog—which included five multiplatinum albums as of 2001—and started the Motley Records label. Mötley Crüe released a greatest hits collection in 1998, a live collection in 1999, and the album New Tattoo in 2000. Dirt: The Autobiography of Mötley Crüe was published in May of 2001.</p>', '/images/artists/MotleyCrue.jpg');

(110, 'Nirvana', '<p>Prior to Nirvana, alternative music was consigned to specialty sections of record stores, and major labels considered it to be, at the very most, a tax write-off. After the band''s second album, 1991''s Nevermind, nothing was ever quite the same, for better and for worse. Nirvana popularized punk, post-punk, and indie rock, unintentionally bringing it into the American mainstream like no other band to date. While their sound was equal parts Black Sabbath (as learned by fellow Washington underground rockers the Melvins) and Cheap Trick, Nirvana''s aesthetics were strictly indie rock. They covered Vaselines songs, they revived new wave cuts by Devo, and leader Kurt Cobain relentlessly pushed his favorite bands -- whether it was the art punk of the Raincoats or the country-fried hardcore of the Meat Puppets -- as if his favorite records were always more important than his own music. While Nirvana''s ideology was indie rock and their melodies were pop, the sonic rush of their records and live shows merged the post-industrial white noise with heavy metal grind. And that''s what made the group an unprecedented multi-platinum sensation. Jane''s Addiction and Soundgarden may have proven to the vast American heavy metal audience that alternative could rock, and the Pixies may have merged pop sensibilities with indie rock white noise, but Nirvana pulled at all together, creating a sound that was both fiery and melodic. Since Nirvana was rooted in the indie aesthetic but loved pop music, they fought their stardom while courting it, becoming some of the most notorious anti-rock stars in history. The result was a conscious attempt to shed their audience with the abrasive In Utero, which only partially fulfilled the band''s goal. But by that point, the fate of the band and Kurt Cobain had been sealed. Suffering from drug addiction and manic depression, Cobain had become destructive and suicidal, though his management and label were able to hide the extent of his problems from the public until April 8, 1994, when he was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound. Cobain may not have been able to weather Nirvana''s success, but the band''s legacy stands as one of the most influential in rock & roll history.</p><p>Kurt Cobain (vocals, guitar) met Chris Novoselic (born Krist Novoselic) (bass) in 1985 in Aberdeen, WA, a small logging town 100 miles away from Seattle. While Novoselic came from a relatively stable background, Cobain''s childhood had been thrown into turmoil when his parents divorced when he was eight. Following the divorce, he lived at the homes of various relatives, developing a love for the Beatles and then heavy metal in the process. Eventually, American hardcore punk worked its way into dominating his listening habits and he met the Melvins, an Olympia-based underground heavy punk band. Cobain began playing in punk bands like Fecal Matter, often with the Melvins'' bassist Dale Crover. Through the Melvins'' leader Buzz Osborne, Cobain met Novoselic, who also had an intense interest in punk, which meant that he, like Cobain, felt alienated from the macho, redneck population of Aberdeen. The duo decided to form a band called the Stiff Woodies, with Cobain on drums, Novoselic on bass, and a rotating cast of guitarists and vocalists. The group went through name changes as quickly as guitarists, before deciding that Cobain would play guitar and sing. Renamed Skid Row, the new trio featured drummer Aaron Burkhart, who left the band by the end of 1986 and was replaced by Chad Channing. By 1987, the band was called Nirvana. \r\n\r\nNirvana began playing parties in Olympia, gaining a cult following. During 1987, the band made ten demos with producer Jack Endino, who played the recordings to Jonathan Poneman, one of the founders of the Seattle-based indie label Sub Pop. Poneman signed Nirvana, and in December of 1988, the band released their first single, a cover of Shocking Blue''s "Love Buzz." Sub Pop orchestrated an effective marketing scheme, which painted the band as backwoods, logging-town hicks, which irritated Cobain and Novoselic. While "Love Buzz" was fairly well-received, the band''s debut album, Bleach, was what began the ball rolling. Recorded for just over 600 dollars and released in the spring of 1989, Bleach slowly became a hit on college radio, due to the group''s consistent touring. Though Jason Everman was credited as a second guitarist on the sleeve of Bleach, he didn''t appear on the record; he only toured in support of the album before leaving the band at the end of the year to join Soundgarden and then Mindfunk. Bleach sold 35,000 copies and Nirvana became favorites of college radio, the British weekly music press, and Sonic Youth, Mudhoney, and Dinosaur Jr., which was enough to attract the attention of major labels.</p><p>During the summer, Nirvana released "Sliver"/"Dive," which was recorded with Mudhoney''s Dan Peters on drums and produced by Butch Vig. The band also made a six-song demo with Vig, which was shopped to major labels, who soon began competing to sign the group. By the end of the summer, Dave Grohl, formerly of the D.C.-based hardcore band Scream, had become Nirvana''s drummer and the band signed with DGC for $287,000. Nirvana recorded their second album with Vig, completing the record in the summer. Following a European tour supporting Sonic Youth in the late summer, Nevermind was released in September, supported by a quick American tour. While DGC was expecting a moderately successful release, in the neighborhood of 100,000 copies, Nevermind immediately became a smash hit, quickly selling out its initial shipment of 50,000 copies and creating a shortage across America. What helped the record become a success was "Smells Like Teen Spirit," a blistering four-chord rocker that was accompanied by a video that shot into heavy MTV rotation. By the beginning of 1992, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" had climbed into the American Top Ten and Nevermind bumped Michael Jackson''s much-touted comeback album Dangerous off the top of the album charts; it reached the British Top Ten shortly afterward. By February, the album had been certified triple platinum. \r\n\r\nNirvana''s success took the music industry by surprise, Nirvana included. It soon become apparent that the band wasn''t quite sure how to handle their success. Around the time of Nevermind''s release, the band was into baiting their audience -- Cobain appeared on MTV''s Headbanger''s Ball in drag, the group mocked the tradition of miming on the BBC''s Top of the Pops by Novoselic constantly throwing his bass into the air and Cobain singing his live vocals in the style of Ian Curtis, and their traditional live destruction of instruments was immortalized on a Saturday Night Live performance that ended with Novoselic and Grohl sharing a kiss -- but by the spring, questions had begun to arise about the band''s stability. Cobain married Courtney Love, the leader of the indie rock/foxcore band Hole, in February of 1992, announcing that the couple was expecting a child in the fall. Shortly after the marriage, rumors that the couple were heavy heroin users began to circulate and the strength of the rumors only increased when Nirvana canceled several summer concerts and refused to mount a full-scale American tour during the summer. Cobain complained that he was suffering from chronic stomach troubles, which seemed to be confirmed when he was admitted to a Belfast hospital after a June concert. But, heroin rumors continued to surface, especially in the form of a late-summer Vanity Fair article which implied that Love was using during her pregnancy. Both Love and Cobain denied the article''s allegations, and publicly harassed and threatened the article''s author. Love delivered Frances Bean Cobain, a healthy baby girl, on August 18, 1992, but the couple soon battled with Los Angeles'' children''s services, who claimed they were unfit parents on the basis of the Vanity Fair article. The couple was granted custody of their child by the beginning of 1993. \r\n\r\nSince Cobain was going through such well-documented personal problems, Nirvana was unable to record a follow-up to Nevermind until the spring of 1993. In the meantime, DGC released the odds-and-ends compilation Incesticide late in 1992; the album reached number 39 in the U.S. and number 14 U.K. As the group prepared to make their third album, they released "Oh, the Guilt" as a split-single with the Jesus Lizard on Touch & Go Records. Choosing Steve Albini (Pixies, the Breeders, Big Black, the Jesus Lizard) as their producer, Nirvana recorded their third album, In Utero, in two weeks during the spring of 1993. Following its completion, controversy began to surround Nirvana again. Cobain suffered a heroin overdose on May 2, but the event was hidden from the press. The following month, Love called police to their Seattle home after Cobain locked himself in the bathroom, threatening suicide. Prior to debuting In Utero material during the New Music Seminar at New York''s Roseland Ballroom in July, Cobain had another covered-up overdose. By that time, reports began to circulate, including an article in Newsweek, that DGC was unhappy with the forthcoming album, accusing that the band deliberately made an uncommercial record. Both the band and the label denied such allegations. Deciding that Albini''s production was too flat, Nirvana decided to remaster the album with R.E.M.''s producer, Scott Litt.</p><p>In Utero was released in September of 1993 to positive reviews and strong initial sales, debuting at the top of the U.S. and U.K. charts. Nirvana supported it with a fall American tour, hiring former Germs member Pat Smear as an auxiliary guitarist. While the album and the tour were both successful, sales weren''t quite as strong as expected, with several shows not selling out until the week of the concert. As a result, the group agreed to play MTV''s acoustic Unplugged show at the end of the year, and sales of In Utero picked up after its December airing. After wrapping up the U.S. tour on January 8, 1994, with a show at Center Arena in Seattle, Nirvana embarked on a European tour in February. Following a concert in Munich on February 29, Cobain stayed in Rome to vacation with Love. On March 4, she awakened to find that Cobain had attempted suicide by overdosing on the tranquilizer Rohypnol and drinking champagne. While the attempt was initially reported as an accidental overdose, it was known within the Nirvana camp that the vocalist had left behind a suicide note.</p><p>Cobain returned to Seattle within a week of his hospitalization and his mental illness began to grow. On March 18, the police had to again talk the singer out of suicide after he locked himself in a room threatening to kill himself. Love and Nirvana''s management organized an intervention program that resulted in Cobain''s admission to the Exodus Recovery Center in L.A. on March 30, but he escaped from the clinic on April 1, returning to Seattle. His mother filed a missing persons report on April 4. The following day, Cobain shot himself in the head at his Seattle home. His body wasn''t discovered until April 8, when an electrician contracted to install an alarm system at the Cobain house stumbled upon the body. After his death, Kurt Cobain was quickly anointed as a spokesman for Generation X, as well as a symbol of its tortured angst.</p><p>Novoselic and Grohl planned to release a double-disc live album at the end of 1994, but sorting through the tapes proved to be too painful, so MTV Unplugged in New York appeared in its place. The album debuted at the top of the British and American charts, as a home video comprised of live performances and interviews from the band''s Nevermind-era, titled Live! Tonight! Sold Out!, was issued at the same time (the project began prior to Cobain''s passing and was completed by surviving bandmembers).</p><p>In 1996, its electric counterpart, From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah, was released, debuting at the top of the U.S. charts. Following Cobain''s death, Grohl formed the Foo Fighters (early rumors that Novoselic would also be a member of the band ultimately proved to be false) -- releasing their self-titled debut album in 1995, followed by The Colour and the Shape in 1997 and There Is Nothing Left to Lose in 1999. Novoselic formed the trio Sweet 75, releasing their debut in the spring of 1997, and also appeared along with former Dead Kennedys'' frontman Jello Biafra and former Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil on the 2000 live set Live From the Battle in Seattle under the name the No W.T.O. Combo.</p><p>By the late ''90s, research began by Novoselic for a proposed box set of previously unreleased songs from throughout Nirvana''s career. The project was supposed to surface in the fall of 2001 (to coincide with the tenth anniversary release of Nevermind), but legal problems began to surface. In 1997, Grohl and Novoselic formed the Nirvana L.L.C. partnership with Courtney Love (who manages Cobain''s estate) -- a company that required a unanimous vote by all three regarding future albums, photos, and anything else Nirvana-related. When all three couldn''t agree on the songs to be included on the box set, the matter was taken to court as Love attempted to dissolve the partnership. The project was ultimately shelved indefinitely as any legal decision was tied up in court.</p>', '/images/artists/Nirvana.jpg'),

(114, 'Ozzy Osbourne', '<p>Ozzy Osbourne was the lead singer of heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath. The band formed in 1968 and included guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward. They cranked up the volume, capitalized on a wild ''black magic'' image and recorded now-classic albums of heavy rock, including Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1971) and Master of Reality (1971). Ozzy left the band in 1979 and the fans followed him. Not only did he have hit records, he was a magnet for controversy: in 1982 his guitarist, Randy Rhoades, was killed when the plane he was riding in buzzed the tour bus and crashed; he once bit the head off a bat while on stage, giving himself a rabies scare; he bit the head off a dove in the offices of record executives he felt were ignoring him; he was sued over his song "Suicide Solution" by the parents of a teenage fan who had killed himself (the case was dismissed); and he was arrested in 1982 for urinating on a historical "shrine" -- The Alamo. Along the way he toured and released successful albums such as Blizzard of Ozz (1980), Bark at the Moon (1983), Ultimate Sin (1986) and Ozzmosis (1995). In 2002 he and his family made it to MTV in a hit "reality sitcom," called The Osbournes, a video journal of their wacky life in an L. A. mansion.</p><p>Osbourne has three children: Aimee (b. 1983), Kelly (b. 1984), Jack (b. 1985); Jack and Kelly became famous from their appearances on The Osbournes...

(118, 'Pearl Jam', '<p>Pearl Jam, the pearl of the early-1990s grunge explosion in Seattle, was one of the most successful musical acts of the decade. The band was formed in Seattle by guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament; they approached drummer Jack Irons from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but he declined to join. However, he recommended a vocalist named Eddie Ved-der. Gossard and Ament sent Vedder a demo tape; Vedder wrote lyrics, added his vocals, and sent it back to them. They encouraged him to come to Seattle, where he joined them, lead guitarist Mike McCready, and drummer Dave Abbruzzese. Their debut album, Ten, was released the same year—it sold a whopping 6.9 million records.</p><p>Led by the moody, reclusive Vedder, Pearl Jam swam straight against the current of their success. "I don’t want to be a star," Vedder was quoted by Brisbane’s Courier-Mail as saying. "It’s not worth it to have my picture taken and my face everywhere. All that you need is the music." Fueled by anti-rock-star fervor, Pearl Jam refused to produce a videos or single for its next record, 1993’s Vs. Even without, the album broke a first week sales record, moving 950, 378 copies and eventually selling nearly six million. The band also insisted that its records be released on vinyl as well as CD. Such stances were seen by some observers as typical rock star posturing. Those opinions were belied, however, by the benefit work Pearl Jam did regularly for the pro-abortion groups Rock For Choice and Voters For Choice as well as for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the Seattle Arts Center and the Rhett Syndrome Foundation.</p><p>The most serious test of Pearl Jam’s principles was set in motion in 1994 when it went head-to-head against Ticketmaster. The group felt—passionately—that the country’s largest distributor of tickets for sporting and entertainment events was abusing its leading position in the market by charging inflated service fees that frequently boosted the price of tickets by $20. Pearl Jam conceived a "low cost" tour that would be affordable to its teenaged fans. It instructed Ticketmaster that tickets should cost no more than $18.50, with a maximum service charge of $1.80. Ticketmaster refused, claiming it had to charge at least $2 to cover its costs. Pearl Jam responded by filing a memorandum with the U.S. Department of Justice that accused Ticketmaster of monopolistic behavior.</p><p>Without Ticketmaster, it proved nearly impossible to put a concert tour together—at least in the short run. The 1994 tour was cancelled, losing the band an estimated $9 million. Nonetheless, defying the ticket mega-company touched a nerve. A host of musical superstars, Soul Asylum, Garth Brooks, Neil Young, U2 and Bad Religion, lined up to support Pearl Jam’s position. In June 1994, Gossard and Ament traveled to Washington to testify in Congressional hearings on whether contractual agreements between Ticketmaster and most major stadiums and concert promoters have violated federal antitrust law.</p><p>Ament later expressed disappointment over how the hearings went. "I really thought we were going go have some impact," he told USA Today. "But somehow it didn’t feel like they took [the issue] seriously. They seemed like they were more interested in getting autographs for their children." Ultimately nothing came of the Justice Department investigation either. In July of 1995, Attorney General Janet Reno ended the probe, saying there was insufficient evidence. Pearl Jam’s experience with the government in the Ticket-master affair was partially responsible for their support of Ralph Nader’s presidential candidacy in 2000. Although the band was sometimes forced to work with specific Ticketmaster venues when it wanted to tour later in 1990s, Pearl Jam went out of its way to avoid using the company whenever possible, coming to an uneasy truce only at the very end of the decade.\r\n\r\nInternal Stresses and Mirror Ball\r\nPearl Jam released Vitalogy in 1994 and like the two earlier records it shot quickly to the top of the Billboard charts. The band released a vinyl version two weeks before the CD came out which made Vitalogy the first vinyl record in years to hit the charts. In its first six months in stores, 4.8 million copies were sold. It was a minor miracle that the record even saw light of day. Their unbelievable success combined with the Ticket-master fight had raised tensions in the band to almost unmanageable levels. "Nobody was communicating well at that point," Ament told USA Today admitting that the group had nearly disbanded.</p><p>However, by February of 1995 (only two months after Vitalogy’s release), the band went into the studio to make a record with Neil Young. They had performed together at Young’s induction in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dinner in New York in January and quickly turned it into a project. Young cancelled his scheduled appearances in the Lollapalooza tour, and within three days of working together in Seattle, they had finished writing five songs. Young’s Mirror Ball was released in the summer of 1995 followed by a joint tour. Young saw no problem playing with musicians old enough to be his children. "In many ways, I feel like Pearl Jam is older than me," he told Time. "There’s an ageless thing to the way they play."\r\n\r\nPearl Jam continued to push the limits of rock with their own albums. No Code was released in the summer of 1996. It was recorded in a number of cities—Chicago, Atlanta, New Orleans, and Seattle. Its songs managed to be "gently reflective without losing their underlying tension," in the words of Newsday’s Letta Tayler. The record drew a variety of responses from reviewers, from gushing praise to verdicts of unlistenability from others.</p><p>Between No Code and 1998’s Yield, drummer David Abbruzzese left the band and was replaced by Ved-der’s old friend, Irons. Irons was credited by some members with lowering still-latent tensions in Pearl Jam and helping the band work better together. Along with other band members, Irons also contributed a song to Yield. It was the first Pearl Jam album on which Vedder sang lyrics he had not written. Shortly after Yields release, however, Irons left and Pearl Jam signed on yet another drummer, Matt Cameron, formerly of Soundgarden.\r\n\r\nIn early 1999, Pearl Jam recorded a version of "Last Kiss," a ballad done by J. Frank Wilson & the Cavaliers in 1964, which it sent as a single to members of its fan club. By March, "Last Kiss" was getting regular airplay on Los Angeles’s KROQ-FM. It quickly spread to other stations in the country, which did not please Pearl Jam, which had refused to release a single since its first album. It found a compromise when it agreed to the single’s inclusion on No Boundaries, an Epic Records compilation to benefit Kosovo refugees.</p><p>Yield showed the power of the Internet for bootleggers when five excerpts from the album were posted on a fan website. In December of 1997, a Syracuse, New York, radio station played a DAT of the record it had somehow obtained without authorization. A fan taped the broadcast and put parts on his fan site. "It came off the radio, so I put it up," said the site’s owner. "The whole idea of the site is to have rare stuff."</p><p>Throughout its career, Pearl Jam has been famous for changing its set list dramatically from show to show and, like the Grateful Dead always did, it always encouraged its fans to tape its shows. It even permitted live FM radio broadcasts of many of its concerts. An unwelcome result of these decisions was a thriving market in expensive Pearl Jam bootlegs. In 2000 the band took an unusual and extreme step against bootlegging. It announced it would release every concert it played in its upcoming European tour. Approximately 70 were originally scheduled, but the tour was abruptly cut short and only 25 sets were released in the fall of 2000. Originally they were meant to be sold only via the Pearl Jam web site, at the bargain price of $10.98 for each two-CD set. However, Epic Records eventually made them available in stores as well, generally at a much higher price. Forty-five shows from a subsequent tour of the United States were later released.</p><p>The band’s summer of 2000 European tour was cut short because of a tragic incident that struck at a performance at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark in June. Security provided by the promoters was lax and poorly trained in responding to emergency situations. They were completely unprepared for the flood of fans that occurred. Nine people were crushed to death in the mob scene. An investigation of the incident absolved Pearl Jam of any blame for the deaths, but the group returned to America stunned and shaken. Once back, the musicians and crew attended counseling to help them deal with the blow. Reportedly, Vedder was depressed for weeks afterward. They decided to handle safety planning for all future shows themselves.</p><p>In October of 2000, Pearl Jam, the grunge rebels of the early 1990s, celebrated their tenth anniversary in an unlikely locale, the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas. The show drew fans from all over the country. Despite the party in the glitter and gambling center, Pearl Jam has remained loyal to most of the principles it espoused throughout the decade: It continued to avoid most interviews, it did not release videos and only rarely singles, and it performed on behalf of organizations involved in worthwhile activist efforts. After a few months in stores, Pearl Jam’s last album, Binaural, had sold only one million units, down significantly from the millions of sales Ten had generated. But Pearl Jam accepted the "decline" philosophically. Such success couldn’t last forever, and anyway, the other grunge bands that had emerged from the Seattle scene were long since history. Pearl Jam were the survivors. What lay ahead in their next ten years? "The danger for a band that goes into its second decade is the temptation to start recycling yourself, but we’ve always been conscious of that," McCready told Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times. "We have insisted on moving forward and trying new things. That’s what makes me think there is a lot of life still in the band."</p>', '/images/artists/placeholder.gif'),
(120, 'Pink Floyd', '<p>Pink Floyd is the premier space rock band. Since the mid-''60s, their music relentlessly tinkered with electronics and all manner of special effects to push pop formats to their outer limits. At the same time they wrestled with lyrical themes and concepts of such massive scale that their music has taken on almost classical, operatic quality, in both sound and words. Despite their astral image, the group was brought down to earth in the 1980s by decidedly mundane power struggles over leadership and, ultimately, ownership of the band''s very name. After that time, they were little more than a dinosaur act, capable of filling stadiums and topping the charts, but offering little more than a spectacular recreation of their most successful formulas. Their latter-day staleness cannot disguise the fact that, for the first decade or so of their existence, they were one of the most innovative groups around, in concert and (especially) in the studio.</p><p>While Pink Floyd are mostly known for their grandiose concept albums of the 1970s, they started as a very different sort of psychedelic band. Soon after they first began playing together in the mid-''60s, they fell firmly under the leadership of lead guitarist Syd Barrett, the gifted genius who would write and sing most of their early material. The Cambridge native shared the stage with Roger Waters (bass), Rick Wright (keyboards), and Nick Mason (drums). The name Pink Floyd, seemingly so far-out, was actually derived from the first names of two ancient bluesmen (Pink Anderson and Floyd Council). And at first, Pink Floyd were much more conventional than the act into which they would evolve, concentrating on the rock and R&B material that were so common to the repertoires of mid-''60s British bands.</p><p>Pink Floyd quickly began to experiment, however, stretching out songs with wild instrumental freak-out passages incorporating feedback; electronic screeches; and unusual, eerie sounds created by loud amplification, reverb, and such tricks as sliding ball bearings up and down guitar strings. In 1966, they began to pick up a following in the London underground; on-stage, they began to incorporate light shows to add to the psychedelic effect. Most importantly, Syd Barrett began to compose pop-psychedelic gems that combined unusual psychedelic arrangements (particularly in the haunting guitar and celestial organ licks) with catchy melodies and incisive lyrics that viewed the world with a sense of poetic, childlike wonder.</p><p>The group landed a recording contract with EMI in early 1967 and made the Top 20 with a brilliant debut single, "Arnold Layne," a sympathetic, comic vignette about a transvestite. The follow-up, the kaleidoscopic "See Emily Play," made the Top Ten. The debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, also released in 1967, may have been the greatest British psychedelic album other than Sgt. Pepper''s. Dominated almost wholly by Barrett''s songs, the album was a charming fun house of driving, mysterious rockers ("Lucifer Sam"); odd character sketches ("The Gnome"); childhood flashbacks ("Bike," "Matilda Mother"); and freakier pieces with lengthy instrumental passages ("Astronomy Domine," "Interstellar Overdrive," "Pow R Toch") that mapped out their fascination with space travel. The record was not only like no other at the time; it was like no other that Pink Floyd would make, colored as it was by a vision that was far more humorous, pop-friendly, and lighthearted than those of their subsequent epics.</p><p>The reason Pink Floyd never made a similar album was that Piper was the only one to be recorded under Barrett''s leadership. Around mid-1967, the prodigy began showing increasingly alarming signs of mental instability. Barrett would go catatonic on-stage, playing music that had little to do with the material, or not playing at all. An American tour had to be cut short when he was barely able to function at all, let alone play the pop star game. Dependent upon Barrett for most of their vision and material, the rest of the group was nevertheless finding him impossible to work with, live or in the studio.</p><p>Around the beginning of 1968, guitarist Dave Gilmour, a friend of the band who was also from Cambridge, was brought in as a fifth member. The idea was that Gilmour would enable the Floyd to continue as a live outfit; Barrett would still be able to write and contribute to the records. That couldn''t work either, and within a few months Barrett was out of the group. Pink Floyd''s management, looking at the wreckage of a band that was now without its lead guitarist, lead singer, and primary songwriter, decided to abandon the group and manage Barrett as a solo act.</p><p>uch calamities would have proven insurmountable for 99 out of 100 bands in similar predicaments. Incredibly, Pink Floyd would regroup and not only maintain their popularity, but eventually become even more successful. It was early in the game yet, after all; the first album had made the British Top Ten, but the group was still virtually unknown in America, where the loss of Syd Barrett meant nothing to the media. Gilmour was an excellent guitarist, and the band proved capable of writing enough original material to generate further ambitious albums, Waters eventually emerging as the dominant composer. The 1968 follow-up to Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets, made the British Top Ten, using Barrett''s vision as an obvious blueprint, but taking a more formal, somber, and quasi-classical tone, especially in the long instrumental parts. Barrett, for his part, would go on to make a couple of interesting solo records before his mental problems instigated a retreat into oblivion.</p><p>Over the next four years, Pink Floyd would continue to polish their brand of experimental rock, which married psychedelia with ever-grander arrangements on a Wagnerian operatic scale. Hidden underneath the pulsing, reverberant organs and guitars and insistently restated themes were subtle blues and pop influences that kept the material accessible to a wide audience. Abandoning the singles market, they concentrated on album-length works, and built a huge following in the progressive rock underground with constant touring in both Europe and North America. While LPs like Ummagumma (divided into live recordings and experimental outings by each member of the band), Atom Heart Mother (a collaboration with composer Ron Geesin), and More... (a film soundtrack) were erratic, each contained some extremely effective music.\r\n\r\nBy the early ''70s, Syd Barrett was a fading or nonexistent memory for most of Pink Floyd''s fans, although the group, one could argue, never did match the brilliance of that somewhat anomalous 1967 debut. Meddle (1971) sharpened the band''s sprawling epics into something more accessible, and polished the science fiction ambience that the group had been exploring ever since 1968. Nothing, however, prepared Pink Floyd or their audience for the massive mainstream success of their 1973 album, Dark Side of the Moon, which made their brand of cosmic rock even more approachable with state-of-the-art production; more focused songwriting; an army of well-time stereophonic sound effects; and touches of saxophone and soulful female backup vocals.\r\n\r\nDark Side of the Moon finally broke Pink Floyd as superstars in the United States, where it made number one. More astonishingly, it made them one of the biggest-selling acts of all time. Dark Side of the Moon spent an incomprehensible 741 weeks on the Billboard album chart. Additionally, the primarily instrumental textures of the songs helped make Dark Side of the Moon easily translatable on an international level, and the record became (and still is) one of the most popular rock albums worldwide.</p><p>It was also an extremely hard act to follow, although the follow-up, Wish You Were Here (1975), also made number one, highlighted by a tribute of sorts to the long-departed Barrett, "Shine On You Crazy Diamond." Dark Side of the Moon had been dominated by lyrical themes of insecurity, fear, and the cold sterility of modern life; Wish You Were Here and Animals (1977) developed these morose themes even more explicitly. By this time Waters was taking a firm hand over Pink Floyd''s lyrical and musical vision, which was consolidated by The Wall (1979).\r\n\r\nThe bleak, overambitious double concept album concerned itself with the material and emotional walls modern humans build around themselves for survival. The Wall was a huge success (even by Pink Floyd''s standards), in part because the music was losing some of its heavy-duty electronic textures in favor of more approachable pop elements. Although Pink Floyd had rarely even released singles since the late ''60s, one of the tracks, "Another Brick in the Wall," became a transatlantic number one. The band had been launching increasingly elaborate stage shows throughout the ''70s, but the touring production of The Wall, featuring a construction of an actual wall during the band''s performance, was the most excessive yet.</p><p>In the 1980s, the group began to unravel. Each of the four had done some side and solo projects in the past; more troublingly, Waters was asserting control of the band''s musical and lyrical identity. That wouldn''t have been such a problem had The Final Cut (1983) been such an unimpressive effort, with little of the electronic innovation so typical of their previous work. Shortly afterward, the band split up -- for a while. In 1986, Waters was suing Gilmour and Mason to dissolve the group''s partnership (Wright had lost full membership status entirely); Waters lost, leaving a Roger-less Pink Floyd to get a Top Five album with Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987. In an irony that was nothing less than cosmic, about 20 years after Pink Floyd shed their original leader to resume their career with great commercial success, they would do the same again to his successor. Waters released ambitious solo albums to nothing more than moderate sales and attention, while he watched his former colleagues (with Wright back in tow) rescale the charts.</p><p>Pink Floyd still had a huge fan base, but there''s little that''s noteworthy about their post-Waters output. They knew their formula, could execute it on a grand scale, and could count on millions of customers -- many of them unborn when Dark Side of the Moon came out, and unaware that Syd Barrett was ever a member -- to buy their records and see their sporadic tours. The Division Bell, their first studio album in seven years, topped the charts in 1994 without making any impact on the current rock scene, except in a marketing sense. Ditto for the live Pulse album, recorded during a typically elaborately staged 1994 tour, which included a concert version of The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety. In 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright reunited to perform at Live 8. Barrett and Wright passed away, respectively, in 2006 and 2008; both were taken by cancer.</p>', '/images/artists/placeholder.gif'),
(124, 'R.E.M.', '<p>When four college guys started a garage band together in Athens, Georgia, in 1980, they had no idea they''d go on to sign a historically lucrative record deal, see the end of their band as they knew it, and reign as one of the most influential bands of their era. University of Georgia students drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills, and vocalist Michael Stipe formed R.E.M. When they started, punk rock was mostly what was being played in garages by angst-ridden youth across America, but R.E.M. (named for the "rapid eye movement" phase of sleep) was busy making catchy guitar pop. R.E.M. signifies the point at which all that misdirected, avant-garde, "alternative" music was driven out of the garage and into heady commercial success.</p><p>At the start R.E.M. was a driven college rock band, often playing two or three shows a night, five nights a week, three weeks a month. They applied the post-punk D.I.Y. (do it yourself) mentality to what they were doing and just played tirelessly. All the experience and exposure showed up well on their first single, "Radio Free Europe" and "Sitting Still," which was released on their local Hib-Tone record label in 1981. "Radio Free Europe" earned them a cult following that led to their first EP, Chronic Town, on IRS records in 1982.</p><p>It wasn''t until 1983 and the release of Murmur that anyone besides critics—and those hip to the Georgia underground—took to R.E.M. But because R.E.M.''s haunting style of folk and rock clashed with the synthetic early ''80s new-wave sound, more people sat up and listened. Murmur peaked at number 136 on the album charts, but Rolling Stone selected it as album of the year and R.E.M. as band of the year. With their 1984 release Reckoning, the sound was still unlike anything else being played at the time and the push behind R.E.M. became even stronger, as did record sales. With at least one release per year on IRS from 1985''s Fables of the Reconstruction to 1988''s greatest hits collection Eponymous, the band gained more and more critical acclaim, fans, and record sales. Their 1987 release Document did the unthinkable, reaching the top ten, and produced a hit single, the antilove song called "The One I Love." But in 1988, R.E.M. grew up.</p><p>In 1988, R.E.M. officially earned the right to be called "sell-outs" by their purist fans. After R.E.M. signed a five-record, $10-million deal with Warner Brothers, people could call them whatever they wanted to, but they had to acknowledge the band as a commercial success. Once they were on top, though, R.E.M. did not fail to look back down and got involved with grassroots political and environmental causes. Stipe spoke out on behalf of Greenpeace, animal rights, and the homeless. After their first release for Warner Bros., Green, R.E.M. had become the world''s most popular band.</p><p>After an exhaustive tour to support the release of Green, during which Stipe cursed Green''s hit single "Stand," which had the entire country humming, as the worst song they''d ever written, the band went on a touring hiatus. They hibernated for three years until the much-anticipated release of Out of Time in 1991. R.E.M. blossomed on Out of Time, both instrumentally and commercially. They used a more exotic selection of instruments, including horns and mandolins. The release sped to number one on the album charts and went quadruple platinum. Its hit singles "Losing My Religion" and "Shiny Happy People," a duet with Kate Pierson of the B-52''s, were the summer anthems of 1991. On 1992''s Automatic for the People, R.E.M. dug deep inside and pulled out a somber, introspective collection of songs. Its hits were "Drive," "Man on the Moon," and "Everybody Hurts."</p><p>When Monster was released in 1994, it seemed geared to be played loudly. R.E.M. rocked harder on this record than on any before. Monster included rockers with reverb-laded guitars and distorted vocals alongside more trademark-sounding songs. The album hit number one almost immediately, although it produced a lukewarm first single, "What''s the Frequency, Kenneth?," which peaked at number 28. To support Monster, the band geared up for its first tour in five years, but canceled it after a few weeks in March 1995 when drummer Bill Berry suffered a near-fatal double brain aneurysm in Switzerland.</p><p>The small-town boys from Georgia made music industry history in 1996, signing a five-record, $80-million deal with Warner Music, the largest record contract ever awarded at the time. The deal came at the end of a bidding war, with DreamWorks, Sony, Capitol, and MCA offering $35 to $50 million. "R.E.M. embodies everything important about this company," Warner Bros. president Steven Baker told the Los Angeles Times. "They are a tremendously hard-working, successful band with integrity and vision." Two weeks later, the band released New Adventures in Hi-Fi, which, although it debuted at number two, wasn''t very well received and enjoyed only lukewarm sales.</p><p>In early October of 1997, on the first day of rehearsals for their new album, drummer Berry decided to leave the band. "Rock drummers are like car tires: they''re regularly replaced, but you don''t get far if you''re missing one," wrote Time in 1998. And if that was the case for any band, it was especially true for R.E.M. The band was always known for working as a democracy—every decision in their 17 years together had been made unanimously. All members received songwriting credit on their albums, drummer Berry included. "I put it to the guys," Berry told Rolling Stone. "I don''t want to do this anymore." Michael Stipe told Rolling Stone in 1998, "I was just consumed by Bill''s departure."</p><p>For the band''s first release after Berry left, 1998''s Up, all ears were tuned to hear the sound of a new R.E.M. "The pulsing drum machine that opens Up hints at what skeptics may have feared: The Berry-less (but not drummerless) R.E.M. may have bought a floor ticket to music''s latest overplayed trend, electronica," Ann Powers wrote in Rolling Stone in 1998. "But the mellotron, harpsichord and other groovy effects on Up never overwhelm the band''s mighty sense of self." Or as David Fricke wrote in Rolling Stone, "Up is the record that Michael Stipe, Peter Buck and Mike Mills would have made with or without departed drummer Bill Berry."</p><p>Up also was a first for Stipe as lyricist: for the first time, his enigmatic song lyrics were printed on the CD''s insert. Stereo Review noted in a 1998 review of Up that Stipe, known for mumbling his often cryptic verse, seemed to be trying to make himself a little clearer. "The most interesting aspect [of Up] is Michael Stipe''s lyrical openness; he has never been more nakedly self revelatory, nor has he enunciated his lyrics with such deliberate precision." The reviews for Up were wildly mixed, from speculation that it was the group''s best record ever to Billboard''s 1998 review of it as a "record that sounds as if the group was sulking all the way through it." In a year-end interview with Rolling Stone in 1998, Stipe had this response: "If this record dropped out of the sky by a three-piece band that nobody had heard of, people would be in the street shouting at the top of their lungs, naked, about it."</p><p>In 1999, R.E.M. recorded the soundtrack for Milos Forman''s Man on the Moon starring Jim Carrey. The soundtrack included R.E.M.''s "Man on the Moon" from Automatic for the People along with "The Great Beyond," which was issued as a single and reached number 57 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Between May and October of 2000, R.E.M. recorded its next album in Ireland and Canada. Reveal was released in 2001 to mixed reviews, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing for All Music Guide that the album was "[just] all a bit too studied to ring true." In 2003, Warner Brothers released a compilation of the band, In Time: The Best of R.E.M., 1988-2003. In addition to offering an overview of the band''s career, In Time featured two new songs, "Animal" and "Bad Day," the latter which charted on the Canadian Singles Chart. In 2003, former drummer Bill Berry joined the band for a brief reunion during a Durham, North Carolina, show.</p><p>R.E.M. returned in 2004 with Around the Sun, an album that a number of critics found directionless. "Ten years after the commercial zenith of Monster and seven years after the departure of linchpin Bill Berry," noted Erlewine, "R.E.M. have never seemed as directionless as they do on their 13th album, Around the Sun." In 2004, R.E.M. joined Bruce Springsteen, Bright Eyes, and others on the Vote for Change tour, and then embarked on the band''s first major world tour in ten years. I.R.S. records released a second compilation of R.E.M. in 2006, And I Feel Fine … The Best of the I.R.S. Years 1982-87, expanding the portrait of the band. On March 12, 2007, R.E.M. was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, and the band performed four songs with drummer Berry.</p><p>In 2008, the band released its 14th album, Accelerate. "One of the benefits of being veterans is knowing how to create a record this focused, and Accelerate benefits greatly from its concentrated blast of guitars, as the brevity of the album makes R.E.M. seem vital even as they''re dredging up the past," wrote Erlewine.</p>', '/images/artists/rem.jpg'),

(127, 'Red Hot Chili Peppers', '<p>Few rock groups of the ''80s broke down as many musical barriers and were as original as the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Creating an intoxicating new musical style by combining funk and punk rock together (with an explosive stage show, to boot), the Chili Peppers spawned a slew of imitators in their wake, but still managed to be the leaders of the pack by the dawn of the 21st century. The roots of the band lay in a friendship forged by three school chums, Anthony Kiedis, Michael Balzary, and Hillel Slovak, while they attended Fairfax High School in California back in the late ''70s/early ''80s. While Balzary and Slovak showed great musical promise (on trumpet and guitar, respectively), Kiedis focused on poetry and acting during his high school career. During this time, Slovak taught Balzary how to play bass, while the duo encouraged Kiedis to start putting his poetry to music, which he soon did. Influenced heavily by the burgeoning L.A. punk scene (the Germs, Black Flag, Fear, Minutemen, X, etc.) as well as funk (Parliament-Funkadelic, Sly & the Family Stone, etc.), the trio began to rehearse with another friend, drummer Jack Irons, leading to the formation of Tony Flow & the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem, a group that played strip bars along the sunset strip during the early ''80s. It was during this time that the quartet honed their sound and live act (as they stumbled across a stage gimmick that would soon become their trademark -- performing on-stage completely naked, except for a tube sock covering a certain part of their anatomy). By 1983, Balzary had begun to go by the name "Flea," and the group changed their name to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.</p><p>Word spread quickly about the up-and-coming band, resulting in a recording contract with EMI. But before the Chili Peppers could begin work on their debut, Flea and Kiedis were dealt a disappointing blow when both Slovak and Irons announced that they were leaving to focus more on another band they were in, What Is This. With replacement members Jack Sherman (guitar) and Cliff Martinez (drums) filling in, the Peppers released their self-titled debut in 1984. But the absence of the two original members showed, as the album failed to capture the excitement of their live show. While the album didn''t set the world on fire sales-wise, the group began to build a dedicated underground following with college radio buffs. By 1985, What Is This was kaput (after issuing a single self-titled album), as Slovak and Irons returned back to the Peppers, resulting in the George Clinton-produced Freaky Styley. While the album was an improvement over its predecessor, it still lacked the fire of the band''s in-concert experience, a problem that would finally be solved with their next album, 1987''s The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. The album was the group''s first to make an impression on the charts, and they followed it up a year later with stopgap five-track release, The Abbey Road EP, in 1988. But just as the world was warming up to the Peppers, tragedy struck when Slovak died from a heroin overdose on June 25, 1988.</p><p>In the wake of Slovak''s death, Irons left the group for the second and final time, while Kiedis (who was also battling drug addiction at the time) and Flea decided to soldier on. After a new lineup consisting of former Parliament guitarist Blackbyrd McKnight and former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro didn''t work out, the duo found worthy replacements in newcomers John Frusciante and Chad Smith. The new-look Chili Peppers hit pay dirt straight away, as their first album together, 1989''s Mother''s Milk, became a surprise hit due to MTV''s exposure of their videos for a cover of Stevie Wonder''s "Higher Ground" and a song about their fallen friend Slovak, "Knock Me Down," as the album was certified gold by early 1990. The group knew that their next release would be the most important one of their career, so they moved into a mansion-turned-recording studio with producer Rick Rubin to work on what would become their most successful release yet, the stripped-down Blood Sugar Sex Magik (their first for the Warner Bros. label). The album became a monster hit upon its September 1991 release (going on to eventually sell a staggering seven million copies in the U.S. alone), as it spawned such hits as "Give It Away" and the group''s first Top Ten single, "Under the Bridge."</p><p>But not all was well in the Chili Peppers camp. Like his predecessor, Frusciante had become addicted to hard drugs, and abruptly left the band mid-tour in early 1992. Undeterred, the band enlisted new member Arik Marshall, and headlined Lollapalooza II in the summer. When the band returned to the studio to work on their sixth release overall, it quickly became apparent that Marshall didn''t fit in, and was replaced by Jesse Tobias. But before Tobias could record a note with the group, he was handed his walking papers as well, and former Jane''s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro signed on. After a layoff of four years, the Peppers'' much-delayed follow-up to BSSM was released in 1995, One Hot Minute. While the album was a sizeable hit, it failed to match the success and musical focus of its predecessor, as it became apparent during the album''s ensuing tour that Navarro wasn''t fitting in as well as originally hoped, and left the band in early 1998.</p><p>After Frusciante had left the group, he released a pair of obscure solo releases, 1995''s Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt and 1997''s Smile from the Streets You Hold, yet rumors circulated that the guitarist was homeless, penniless, and sickly with a death-defying drug habit. After checking himself into rehab and putting his demons behind him, Frusciante emerged once again refocused and re-energized, and promptly accepted an invitation to rejoin the Peppers once more. The group''s reunion album, 1999''s Californication, proved to be another monster success, reconfirming the Chili Peppers as one of alternative rock''s top bands. The band put in a quick guest appearance on Fishbone''s Psychotic Friends Nuttwerx before hitting the road to support the album. The following months found the band getting involved in bizarre situations and controversies. First, their refusal to play songs from One Hot Minute during the tour was an unpopular decision with some fans and a sore spot for Dave Navarro. Next, they reignited a personal feud between Kiedis and Mr. Bungle singer Mike Patton by refusing to play a series of European concerts with Bungle. Patton responded with a "tribute" show for the Peppers, where Bungle mocked their stage moves, faked shooting up heroin, and imitated Kiedis'' comments about Patton. They also played the ill-fated Woodstock ''99 festival, where their headlining performance was met with piles of burning rubble and a full-scale riot. Tours with the Foo Fighters and Pearl Jam brought them into the next year without problems, but they stepped off the road after a planned stop in Israel was halted due to security worries. They returned to the studio in November of 2001 and by the summer of 2002 they had a new album ready to drop, By the Way. Warner Brothers released a Greatest Hits compilation in 2003, followed by a chart-topping two-CD album of all-new material, Stadium Arcadium, in 2006.</p>', '/images/artists/RedHotChiliPeppers.jpg'),

After a few years as a sideman in and around Austin, Vaughan formed the band Double Trouble, with whom he made four successful studio albums and established a reputation as one of the foremost blues guitarists in the world. He was noted for using the Fender Stratocaster, with several guitars being made in tribute to Vaughan, including a Signature Stratocaster and a replica of his famous Strat named ''''Lenny''''.

(142, 'The Rolling Stones', '<p>It''s hard to overestimate the importance of the Rolling Stones in rock & roll history. The group, which formed in London in 1962, distilled so much of the music that had come before it and has exerted a decisive influence on so much that has come after. Only a handful of musicians in any genre achieve that stature, and the Stones stand proudly among them.</p><p>Every album the group released through the early Seventies - from The Rolling Stones in 1964 to Exile on Main Street in 1972 -- is essential not simply to an understanding of the music of that era, but to an understanding of the era itself. In their intense interest in blues and R&B, the Stones connected a young American audience to music that was unknown to the vast majority of white Americans. Though the Stones were not overtly political in their early years, their obsession with African American music - from Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters and Howlin'' Wolf to Chuck Berry, Marvin Gaye and Don Covay - struck a chord that resonated with the goals of the civil rights movement. If the Stones had never made an album after 1965 they would still be legendary.</p><p>Soon, of course, the Stones - singer Mick Jagger, guitarists Keith Richards and Brian Jones, bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts, in those days - became synonymous with the rebellious attitude of that era. Songs like "(I Can''t Get No) Satisfaction," "Street Fighting Man," "Sympathy for the Devil" and "Gimme Shelter" captured the violence, frustration and chaos of that era. For the Stones, the Sixties were not a time of peace and love; in many ways, the band found psychedelia and wide-eyed utopianism confusing and silly. The Stones always were - and continue to be - tough pragmatists. Against the endless promises of Sixties idealism the Stones understood that "You Can''t Always Get What You Want." You simply want to Let It Be? Why not Let It Bleed?</p><p>For those reasons, as the Sixties drained into the Seventies, the Stones went on a creative run that rivals any in popular music. Beggars Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main Street (1972) routinely turn up on lists of the greatest albums of all time, and deservedly so. All done with American producer Jimmy Miller - "in incredible rhythm man," in Richards'' terse description - those records shake like the culture itself was shaking. As the Stones were working on Let It Bleed, Brian Jones died, and the band replaced him with Mick Taylor, a guitarist whose lyricism and melodic flair counterbalanced Richards'' insistent, irreducible rhythmic drive, adding an element to the band''s sound that hadn''t been there before, and opening fertile new musical directions.</p><p>After that, the Stones were an indomitable force on the music scene, and they have continued to be to this day. In 1978, the band''s album, Some Girls, rose to the challenge of punk ("When the Whip Comes Down") - whose energy and attitude the Stones had defined a decade earlier - but also swung with the sinuous grooves of disco ("Miss You"). The album is one of the best of that decade. Meanwhile, guitarist Ron Wood had replaced Mick Taylor in 1975, adding another key element to the version of the Rolling Stones that would last another three decades - and counting.</p><p>Tattoo You (1981) added the classics "Start Me Up" and "Waiting on a Friend" to the Stones'' repertoire, and took its prominent place among the Stones'' most compelling - and most popular - later albums. Possibly the most underrated album of the Stones'' career, Dirty Work finds the band at its rawest and most rhythmically charged, a reflection of the tumult within the band when it was recorded. True Stones fans have long worn their appreciation of Dirty Work as a hip badge of honor.</p><p>With the release of Steel Wheels in 1989, the Stones went back on the road again for the first time in seven years and inaugurated the latest phase of the band''s illustrious career. They''ve made strong, credible new albums during this period - Voodoo Lounge (1994), Bridges to Babylon (1997) - along with the excellent live album Stripped (1995) and the fun, satisfying hits collection, Forty Licks (2002).</p><p>More significantly, though, the Stones have set a standard for live performance during this time. That is an achievement completely in accord with the band''s history. When the Stones began to be introduced on their 1969 tour as "The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World,'' they were staking that claim on the basis of their live performances. It was almost fashionable for bands to withdraw from the road at that time - Bob Dylan and the Beatles had both done so. But the Stones set out to prove that writing brilliant songs and making powerful records did not mean that you were too lofty to get up in front of your fans and rock them until their bones rattled. The Stones'' live shows - epitomized, of course, by Jagger''s galvanizing erotic choreography - had earned the band its reputation in its earliest years, and that flame was being rekindled.</p><p>It was lit again twenty years later, and it''s burning still. Since 1989 the Stones have toured every few years to ecstatic response. Bassist Darryl Jones, who had formerly played with Miles Davis, joined the band in 1994, replacing Bill Wyman, and the Stones turned what could have been a setback into a rejuvenating rush of new energy. The Stones'' live success during this period is not a matter of dollars or box-office breakthroughs, though the band has enjoyed plenty of both. It''s about demonstrating a vital, ongoing commitment to the idea that performing is what keeps a band truly alive.</p><p>And that''s the critical misunderstanding of the question, "Is this the last time?" that has been coming up every time the Stones have toured for close to forty years now. It''s true that over the decades the Stones have been in the news for many reasons that have little to do with music - arrests, provocative statement, divorces, affairs, all the usual detritus of a raucous lifetime in the public eye. And there''s no doubt that Mick Jagger is as famous a celebrity as the world has ever seen.</p><p>But, for all that, the Stones are best understood as musicians, and their own acceptance of that fact is what has enabled them to carry on so well for so long. For all the tabloid headlines, Mick Jagger is finally an extraordinary lead singer and one of the most riveting performers - in any genre - ever to set foot on a stage. Keith Richards is the propulsive engine that drives the Stones and makes their music instantly recognizable. Ron Wood is a guitarist who has formed a rhythmic brotherhood with Richards, but who also colors and textures the band''s songs with deft, melodic touches. And Charlie Watts, needless to say, is one of rock''s greatest drummers. He is both the rock that anchors the band, and the force that swings it. At once elegant in their simplicity and soaring in their impact, none of his gestures are wasted, all are necessary. He and Darryl Jones enliven the often-monolithic notion of the rock & roll rhythm section with an irresistible, unpretentious, jazz-derived sophistication.</p><p>Musicians live and create in the moment, and that''s why fans still go see the Stones. Certainly there''s also a catalogue of songs that only a handful of artists could rival. Surely there''s also the desire to encounter a band that has played a pristine role in defining our very idea of what rock & roll is. But seeing the Rolling Stones live is to see a working band playing as hard as they can, and there''s no last time for that.</p>', '/images/artists/TheRollingStones.jpg'),
(144, 'The Who', '<p>The Who are a four-piece mod/rock band whose first album, My Generation, bristled with attitude; the lyric "I hope I die before I get old" tapped into the disaffection felt by post-war baby boomers, helping to secure a loyal fanbase and establish the band at the forefront of the mod movement.</p><p>In the studio the band''s innovative approach to recording helped to realise Townshend''s vision and album and single success followed, notably taking the concept album to new heights in the shape of Tommy and Quadrophenia, both of which were made into successful films.</p><p>During live performances, including appearances at Woodstock and The Isle of Wight Festival, they became renowned for smashing their instruments, and at one point held the Guinness World Record for the loudest concert. Off-stage, they cemented their rock and roll reputation by wrecking hotel rooms and parking a Rolls Royce in a swimming pool.</p><p>The death of drummer Keith Moon saw the band separate in 1978, although, with Kenney Jones and Zak Starkey on drums, they reformed for one-off events, such as Live Aid in 1985. Plans to reform and produce new material were dealt another blow with the death of John Entwistle in 2002, although Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend still tour together as The Who. In 2006 Daltrey and Townshend released Endless Wire, the first Who album in 24 years</p>', '/images/artists/TheWho.jpg'),

(150, 'U2', '<p>One of the biggest bands of the last 25 years, U2 began life in Dublin, Ireland in 1976, holding their first rehearsal in the kitchen of drummer Larry Mullen Jr. From that inauspicious beginning U2 flourished, eventually becoming permanently woven into the pop-culture fabric of modern Western society. Playing under several different names, and at one time with a line-up of seven musicians, it was in 1978 that the band officially became both U2 and a foursome, and their final line-up -- Paul "Bono" Hewson on vocals, Dave "The Edge" Evans on lead guitar, Adam Clayton on bass, and Larry Mullen on drums -- hasn''t changed. This quartet won a talent competition in Limerick and brought themselves to the attention of the man who became their manager, Paul McGuinness.</p><p>After the release of U2''s only EP, Three (1979), they signed a record deal with Island Records and released their first full-length album Boy. This was followed by the overtly Christian October in 1981, and although they haven''t made such an obviously spiritual album since, their faith has been a common thread through their career, albeit latterly expressed in a more humanitarian manner. It was the 1983 album War that provided the breakthrough for the band. War featured strong themes of political protest and spun the band''s first signature song "Sunday Bloody Sunday", about the 1972 incident in which 14 innocent Irish protesters were shot and killed by British troops. From thereafter, U2 continued to write songs with themes of political or social significance.</p><p>At 1985''s Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium, London, U2 cemented their reputation as vehement humanitarians and aggressive pacifists. Their performance culminated in Bono stage diving to dance in the embrace of a fan, and their earnest, eager pleas for donations to help the people of Ethiopia ensured their appearance was of the most memorable of the day.</p><p>Their fifth album The Joshua Tree (1987) was their most successful to date, being their most critically acclaimed (No.26 on Rolling Stone''s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list), most commercially successful (multi-platinum in five countries, selling more than 10 million copies in the US alone), and winning the band their first Grammy Awards (Album of the Year and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal).</p><p>Although U2 have never repeated the phenomenal success of The Joshua Tree, they have continued to record albums and tour very successfully; other notable albums by U2 include Achtung Baby (1991) and All That You Can''t Leave Behind (2000). They also work for many charities including: Amnesty International, Chernobyl Children''s Project and Make Poverty History.</p>', '/images/artists/u2.jpg'),
(151, 'UB40', '<p>Almost like a pop-music testament to the postulate that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, the strength of UB40, the enormously successful British reggae band, lies in the strong communal bond that holds its multi-racial membership together. All eight members of the group—brothers Robin and Ali Campbell, who play guitar and sing; singer, trumpeter, and "toaster," or rapper, Astro; saxophonist Brian Travers; keyboardist Michael Virtue; drummer Jimmy Brown; percussionist Norman Hassan, and bassist Earl Falconer—were born and raised in Balsall Heath, a neighborhood in the English Midlands industrial city of Birmingham, an area that has always attracted large numbers of West Indians, Asian Indians, and working-class whites and blacks looking for scarce jobs.</p><p>Though times were tough growing up in that neighborhood in the 1960s, Travers told Time''s Jay Cocks: "Don''t get the idea that we grew up poor, because we didn''t. We didn''t go hungry and have holes in our shoes or anything." And rather than being torn apart by large-scale unemployment or racial tension, the members of UB40 came together in those days with the help of music, specifically the charged rhythms of Jamaican reggae and the lyric melodies of Motown that were popular in Balsall Heath. "At the age when you start to form your musical allegiances," Robin Campbell told Rolling Stone, "we were hearing reggae. They used to play it at ear-bleeding volume, so you couldn''t help but hear it."</p><p>Considering that at the time of UB40''s inception none of its members could play an instrument, the birth of the group was somewhat curious. Then seventeen, Ali Campbell "got very drunk and upset somebody," brother Robin told Rolling Stone''s Parke Puterbaugh, "and he got a flying glass in his face." With the money he received from criminal injuries compensation, Ali went out and bought a guitar and drum set, and the others went out and bought instruments for themselves.</p><p>What UB40 lacked in musical talent in those early days, they more than made up for with self-confidence and ambition. Embarking on their "master plan," the group, which they named after the all-too-familiar unemployment benefits application form, had plenty of time to practice in a cellar, where they honed their sound and practiced scribbling their soon-to-be-famous autographs on the walls. To avoid becoming merely a local favorite, the band vowed to play its hometown only once every six weeks, and spread word that in the times between they were on the road touring, when in fact they were usually right back in the cellar practicing. The first producer to show genuine interest in UB40 was Bob Lamb, who played the group''s demo tape for several influential DJs and eventually got them signed to the Graduate record label. The band''s second single, "King," received extensive airplay, and when Chrissie Hynde, lead singer of the path-breaking group Pretenders, heard UB40 playing in a London pub, she invited them to join her band on its upcoming tour.</p><p>The exposure brought on by this popular tour catapulted UB40 into instant stardom. Their subsequent album, Signing Off, became the first reggae record to reach the British pop 30, and UB40 has since amassed more than 25 hit singles in the United Kingdom. But in the recording industry, to achieve true stardom and, of course, financial success, the greatest test for a group is whether or not it can conquer America. Strangely, UB40''s first foray into the American pop world fell astonishingly flat. "No, no, no, it just doesn''t happen this way," Time''s Jay Cocks sarcastically wrote of that ill-fated venture. "Smash Brit band, bedecked with hit singles and platinum albums from abroad, storms U.S. shores in 1983. Plays some concerts, manages to squeeze one hit onto the low midrange of the singles charts, then goes back home. Modest hit single, which had reached the number one spot in twelve other countries, expires from widespread Stateside indifference."</p><p>The "modest hit single" Cocks refers to was "Red Red Wine," from the LP Labour of Love, a compilation of all cover songs taken from favorites the band had over the years of listening to reggae. Ironically, "Red Red Wine" was not, like most of the songs on the album, a classic Jamaican reggae hit; rather, it was penned in 1968 by the legendary Tin Pan Alley songwriter Neil Diamond and first covered by Tony Tribe. "Red Red Wine" was a number one single in Britain and a smash hit worldwide, but American audiences strangely shunned it when UB40''s new label, A&M Records, released it in 1983. Meanwhile, in the ensuing years the group released two critically acclaimed albums of original songs, Rat in the Kitchen (1986) and UB40 (1988), which were both, again, well-received in the United Kingdom and hardly noticed in the United States.</p><p>In fact, UB40''s breakthrough in the American market did come finally in 1988, but it had nothing to do with either of these fine albums. Rather, it came with a lot of luck, by way of the whim of Phoenix radio station KZZP which, for some strange reason, put the five-year-old single "Red Red Wine" on its playlist in May of that year. By August, the song was the station''s most requested single, and other album-rock stations around the country began playing the record with such success that A&M decided to re-release it. By October "Red Red Wine" was the number one song on the Billboard charts. This belated success left some of the band members admittedly a little confused and ambivalent about the market in the United States, but as Astro told Rolling Stone, "Who cares? As long as it''s a hit, I''ll accept it."</p><p>Labour of Love received more belated honors when it was named among Rolling Stone''s Top 100 albums of the 1980s. The emphasis in making that record, Robin Campbell told the magazine, was to reestablish reggae as an enjoyable musical form in its own right, rather than merely a vehicle for religious or political messages as it had come to be known since Bob Marley''s Rastafarian days. Campbell said that before Marley, reggae was simply a form of Jamaican pop music, meant for dancing and feeling good. "It''s African and calypso rhythms fused together with American rhythm and blues. All it''s ever been is homemade pop music, and it just gets up my nose when people start talking about reggae as a political or religious music."</p><p>But that does not explain the overtly political and social flavor of much of UB40''s original music. Indeed, the band often targets the harshness of capitalism and racism and the injustice in South Africa. Perhaps this is why UB40 was extended an invitation to play a short tour in the Soviet Union in 1986, an experience that may have opened the band''s eyes a little about life in that country. For instance, though the concerts were sold out everywhere, the fans, under the watchful eyes of special security police, were not allowed to dance to the music; and when the band members spoke directly to the audience about the meaning in a particular song, the Soviet translator often misconstrued their meaning to make it less "controversial." "There''d have to be some pretty strong persuasion to make me come back here," a frustrated Robin Campbell told Rolling Stone.</p><p>UB40 instead likes to make itself a little commune. The band members all remained in Balsall Heath after their successes, albeit in nicer houses, and the democratic make-up of the group has created only one strict rule: "Do what you do easiest." And in 1988 the group got together to realize the ultimate dream of all boyhood chums when they purchased 270 acres of land on an island south of Jamaica. "We thought, ''Why don''t we buy a place and build ourselves a bunch of houses and a shop and a bar and just have our own little community?''" Robin told Rolling Stone. "Sounds like funtome."</p><p>Following its success in the United States, the group released another album of covers, Labour of Love II (1989), which spawned top ten hits in covers of "The Way You Do the Things You Do" by the Temptations, and "Here I Am (Come and Take Me)" by Al Green. A cover of Elvis Presley''s "Can''t Help Falling in Love" cemented the group''s American following, staying for seven weeks at the top of the charts and appearing in the motion picture Sliver starring Sharon Stone. Promises and Lies followed Labour of Love II in 1993, made the number six spot on the Billboard top reggae charts in the United States, and hit number one on the British charts.</p><p>Albums released by the group through the remainder of the 1990s and into the 2000s, including Guns in the Ghetto (1997), Labour of Love III (1998), and The Very Best of UB40 (2000), routinely landed on the number one position on the reggae charts. In 2004, UB40''s cover of "Every Breath You Take" by the Police was featured in the film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore.</p>', '/images/artists/placeholder.gif'),
(152, 'Van Halen', '<p>With groundbreaking musicianship and energetic showmanship, Van Halen dominated the hard rock scene for more than two decades. Guitarist Edward Van Halen was the one constant draw for fans throughout the years, as the band went through three different singers who brought varying styles to Van Halen’s music.</p><p>Beginning with David Lee Roth in the late 1970s, the group established itself as a powerful musical force. When Roth left the band in 1985, he was replaced by established solo artist Sammy Hagar, who took Van Halen to the top of the album charts for more than ten years. Then, in the late 1990s, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone took center stage with yet another change in style and musical direction. Throughout the changes, Eddie Van Halen continued to forge strong musical partnerships with each of the frontmen and ensured the band’s survival by establishing himself as one of the most revolutionary guitarists in rock music. As James Rotondi wrote of Eddie in Guitar Player, "He not only redefined electric guitar technique, but he immeasurably changed the sound, structure, and style of the instrument itself."</p><p>Eddie and his brother, drummer Alex Van Halen, were both born in Holland and moved to Pasadena, California, in 1962. Their father, Jan Van Halen, played saxophone and clarinet in jazz bands, and encouraged his sons’ interest in music. In 1965, the Van Halen brothers formed their first band, the Broken Combs, when Alex was just 13 years old and Eddie was 11. Eddie played piano and Alex played saxophone in the Broken Combs’ lunchroom performances at Hamilton Elementary School.</p><p>A year after they formed their first band, Eddie decided to buy a drum set with money he made on his paper route. At the same time, Alex bought a guitar and took flamenco guitar lessons. While Eddie was delivering papers, Alex would often play on his drum set, and soon the brothers switched instruments. As teenagers, they formed another band called Revolver, and later performed in a group called Mammoth.</p><p>In 1973, Eddie and Alex decided to enroll in Pasadena City College to take classes in music theory. There they met singer David Lee Roth and bassist Michael Anthony. First they convinced Roth to leave his band, the Red Ball Jets, to join Mammoth. At one of their nightclub performances, Anthony’s band, Snake, opened the show, and not long after, they invited him to join Mammoth. When they discovered that another band had already trademarked the name, the Van Halen brothers wanted to change the name to Rat Salade. Roth convinced them that Van Halen would make a better choice.</p><p>As the group developed, Eddie and Roth became the center of attention. Eddie would later demand recognition for his brother Alex’s musical talent, but Anthony remained in the background throughout his career. "It’s a little restricting playing behind a guitarist like Ed," Anthony told JasObrecht in Guitar Player, "but it feels good because of who he is."</p><p>Van Halen played local clubs and parties for four years before they got the attention of Warner Bros. Records’ staff producer Ted Templeman. He saw the band play to a small crowd at the Starwood in Los Angeles and was amazed attheir performance. "I saw their sets," Templeman later told Debby Miller in Rolling Stone, "and there were like 11 people in the audience, and they were playing like they were at [a large stadium like] the Forum." Templeman convinced label president Mo Ostin to sign the band, and they embarked on the beginning of a long, successful rock career with Warner Bros. Records. Their self-titled debut was released in 1978, and the first single was a cover version of the Kinks’ "You Really Got Me." The album went on to sell more than 10 million copies worldwide. "The vision was that we would play whatever kind of music we wanted, regardless of trends, and that we would exhibit our true personalities," Roth told Nancy Collins in Rolling Stone. "Then, if people like it, you’re going to be a star."</p><p>Van Halen went on their first tour, then quickly returned to the studio to record and release Van Halen ll in 1979. This sophomore effort included the hits "Dance the Night Away" and "Beautiful Girls." The band kept up their fast pace in 1980 with the release of Women and Children First, which took only two-and-a-half weeks to record. With hits such as "And the Cradle Will Rock" and "Everybody Wants Some," the album climbed to the top ten on Billboards album chart just one week after its release.</p><p>Eddie was amazed at how fast the group rocketed to the top. "Just three years ago, I was fighting my way up front with the rest of the kids to see Aerosmith," he said to Mikal Gilmore in Rolling Stone. "Then, a year later, we were playing with them…. I knew I’d always play guitar, but I had no idea I’d be in the position I’m in now."</p><p>Sales seemed to have peaked with Women and Children First as Van Halen’s next two albums—Fair Warning and Diver Down—sold about half the number of copies of their debut. Eddie later said that he regretted the number of cover songs the band recorded on Diver Down, which included the hits "Pretty Woman" and "Dancing in the Streets." "I’d rather bomb making music that comes through me than be in the world’s biggest cover band," Eddie explained to Ray Rogers in Interview.</p><p>Van Halen’s slump ended in 1984, and their climb to the top resumed with the release of their number-one single "Jump" and the album 1984. It was the first time the group used a significant amount of keyboards on an album, and fans responded favorably. The band followed the release with more hit songs from the album, including "Panama" and "I’ll Wait," and a successful world tour.</p><p>High on the success of 1984, singer Roth decided to release a solo EP the following year. Herecorded four cover tunes on Crazy from theHeatand began discussing a possible movie deal with the same title. According to the remaining members of Van Halen, Roth decided he wanted to pursue a solo career in music and an acting careerand left the band. Roth explained his sideto David Rensin in Playboy, "Edward wanted to make music that took more than a year in the studio and play it live for two months. I wanted to make music in half that time and play it twice as much."</p><p>Faced with a vacant singer slot in the band, Van Halen began brainstorming for a replacement. They considered recording an album using different singers on each song, then ultimately decided to maintain a group. One day, Eddie was getting his car fixed, and his auto mechanic, Claudio Zampolli, suggested he talk to singer Sammy Hagar. He spoke to Hagar right then from the mechanic’s phone and invited him to jam with the band. Eddie had been a fan of Hagar’s singing and songwriting when the singer fronted the band Montrose in the mid-1970s. They also worked with the same producer, Ted Templeman.</p><p>Hagar met with the band, rehearsed with them, and by the end of 1985, he became Van Halen’s new singer. In the beginning, the new incarnation of Van Halen and Roth continued to talk about each other in the press. "One thing about Roth," Eddie told Steve Dougherty in People, "he’s not half the singer Sammy is, but he is creative. I’m not slagging him about the music. Onstage he was fine. It was offstage that he made having a human relationship impossible."</p><p>Van Halen’s first release with Hagar, 5150, was a huge success and became the band’s first of several number-one albums. It included hit songs like, "Why Can’t This Be Love," "Best of Both Worlds," and "Dreams." The group sold out every show on their 38-city tour, and constantly boasted about the strong bond between the members. "I don’t know what it is about the guy," Alex said in Rolling Stone. "You could be having the worst day of your life, but you walk in and there’s Sammy. And it just makes my day."</p><p>Eddie explained how Hagar freed up his songwriting options, too, in an interview with David Wild in Rolling Stone. "From the first second, Sammy could do anything I threw at him," he said. "I’m in heaven because now I can write whatever I want and not worry because Sammy can sing it all."</p><p>Van Halen released its second album with Hagar in 1988 called OU812. With tracks like, "Finish What Ya Started" and "When It’s Love," the album quickly climbed to number one on Billboard’s album charts. In the summer of that year, the group headlined the Monsters of Rock tour, which also included Metallica, Dokken, and the Scorpions.</p><p>After taking a couple of years off, Van Halen returned with a vengeance in 1991 with the harder-edged, number-one album For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. The CD included the megahit "Right Now," which exposed the band to even wider audiences. "When we first cut ‘Right Now,’ I almost didn’t add a guitar to it because it sounded great with just piano, bass, and drums," Eddie Van Halen told James Rotondi in Guitar Player. "It’s not that I care less about the guitar, but the song as a whole means more to me."</p><p>Van Halen recorded a socio-political video to accompany the song, which was produced by Carolyn Mayer and directed by Mark Fenske. The video became one of the most requested videos on MTV, and won "Best Video," "Best Art Direction," and "Best Editing" at the MTV Video Music Awards.</p><p>In 1993, the band released a live album from the tour for For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, which was called Van Halen Live: Right Here, Right Now. Later that year, their longtime manager, Ed Leffler, died of thyroid cancer. This tragic event sent the members of the group into a time of reflection, and eventually was referenced as the turning point that led to the next lineup change.</p><p>Their next album, Balance, was released in 1995, and debuted at number one on the charts. Eddie explained his impression of the album’s title to David Wild in Rolling Stone, "I think of it as the balance between the four of us that makes everything work." While recording Balance, the band hired a new manager: Ray Danniels, Alex’s brother-in-law and longtime manager of Rush. However, the death of Leffler had already began to take its toll on the group. "With Ed dying last year, it was the first time that we have had a reality check in the nine years I’ve been with the band," Sammy Hagar told Craig Rosen in Billboard.</p><p>According to Hagar, Danniels’ involvement with Van Halen began to cause friction between its members. The group recorded the song "Humans Being" for the Twister soundtrack. Alex and Eddie also recorded an instrumental track on their own for the soundtrack called "Respect the Wind." The group was in the process of recording another song for the soundtrack when Eddie and Hagar got into a dispute about the lyrics. Danniels also informed Hagar that the song would instead be used on a greatest hits record, which Hagar was against releasing in the first place.</p><p>On June 20, 1996, Hagar was either fired from Van Halen or quit, depending on who’s recounting the story. Eddie insisted that Hagar left to pursue a solo career, just as David Lee Roth had in 1985. "I did not quit this band," Hagar told Chris Willman in Entertainment Weekly. "I was forced out of this band. And I would be back in this band tomorrow if they got a new manager and wanted me."</p><p>Van Halen proceeded with the greatest hits album, and recruited former singer David Lee Roth to record two new songs for the release. Van Halen: Best of Volume 1 was released with the new tracks "Can’t Get This Stuff No More" and "Me Wise Magic," and rumors of a Roth reunion spread like wildfire. When MTV invited Van Halen, with Roth, to present an award at the Video Music Awards, it seemed as if the rumors had been confirmed. However, Van Halen insisted a reunion was never part of the plan.</p><p>"I asked him [Roth] to do a song for the Van Haien: Best of because I wanted it to have something new," Eddie Van Halen explained to Anthony Bozza in Rolling Stone. "Then MTV and everybody else—including him—thought it was a reunion."</p><p>After another fallout with the members of his former band, Roth released a public statement on October 2, 1996, explaining his side of the story. "I was an unwitting participant in this deception," he wrote. "It sickens me that the reunion as seen on MTV was nothing more than a publicity stunt…. Those who know me know trickery was never my style."</p><p>During this same time, Danniels had recommended former Extreme singer Gary Cherone as a possible new singer for the band. Danniels was the manager for Extreme before the band broke up the previous year. After meeting with him, Van Halen hired Cherone as the new f rontman and began writing songs for a new album. Former singer Hagar returned to his own solo career and released his first album since the breakup in 1997, titled Marching to Mars. "I took two weeks to think about what happened," Hagar told Tom Sinclair in Entertainment Weekly. "Then I went into the studio and started writing songs." After taking some time to let the dust settle, Hagar also expressed an interest in eventually performing with the group sometime in the future. "If I never walk on stage with Eddie Van Halen again, I’ll be really disappointed," he said.</p><p>In 1998, Van Halen released their first album with their third singer, appropriately titled Van Halen III. On this record, Eddie not only contributed to writing the lyrics, but also sang on the track "How Many Say I?" He described the album to Chris Willman in Entertainment Weekly as "heavier than anything we’ve ever done and deeper on an emotional level; the kind of stuff that gives you goose bumps." However, some critics and fans didn’t have the same positive reaction. "Cherone has one speed as a singer on III— pained exertion," Greg Kot wrote in Rolling Stone, "and longtime bassist Michael Anthony and drummer Alex Van Halen sound as though they’re lumbering at any tempo." Tom Sinclair wrote in Entertainment Weekly, "Despite the anointing of yet another lead singer, Van Halen III is more chunky guitar feast than vocal tour de force."</p><p>The members of Van Halen insisted that the album’s decrease in sales and increase in criticism was immaterial.

It was a process which was complicated by Weiland''s court appearances for drug charges and subsequent stint in rehab. The album was released in 2004 and debuted at No.1 on the Billboard charts. It has subsequently sold in excess of two million copies, due in part to the band''s relentless touring schedule to promote it.</p><p>The second album Libertad was released in 2007 and debuted at No.5 on the Billboard 200 but by 2008, tensions between the erratic Weiland and the rest of the band were at an all-time high.

(157, 'Dread Zeppelin', '<p>Dread Zeppelin channeled the musical spirits of Led Zeppelin, Elvis Presley, and Bob Marley to create tongue-in-cheek novelty rock heartily endorsed by no less an authority than Robert Plant himself. Led by one Tortelvis -- a 300-pound Elvis impersonator born Greg Tortell -- the lineup also included guitarists Jah Paul Jo (Joe Ramsey) and Carl Jah (Carl Haasis), bassist Butt-Boy (Gary Putman), percussionist Ed Zeppelin (Bryant Fernandez), and drummer Fresh Cheese (Paul Masselli); playing their debut live gig on January 8, 1989 (the 54th anniversary of the King''s birth), the Pasadena, CA-based group performed reggae-influenced renditions of classic Led Zep anthems capped off by Presley-like vocals, an approach perhaps best exemplified by gene-spliced songs like "Heartbreaker (At the End of Lonely Street)." Growing local buzz soon earned Dread Zeppelin a deal with IRS Records, and in 1990 the group issued their debut LP Un-led-Ed; in addition to surprisingly strong sales, the record''s cover of "Your Time Is Gonna Come" also earned high marks from former Led Zep frontman Plant, who admitted he preferred their updated rendition over the original.</p><p>Dread Zeppelin''s second album, 5,000,000*, followed in 1991, but already the joke was growing stale, and the following summer Tortelvis, Ed Zeppelin, and Fresh Cheese left the band; Butt-Boy rechristened himself Gary B.I.B.B. and assumed vocal duties for the follow-up, 1992''s It''s Not Unusual, a disco record which effectively alienated much of their core audience as well as executives at IRS, who dropped the group immediately after. Tortelvis and Ed Zeppelin returned for 1993''s Hot & Spicy Beanburger, a return to past glories issued on Jah Paul Jo''s own Birdcage label; shortly after Dread Zeppelin made a cameo in the 1994 film comedy National Lampoon''s Last Resort, Carl Jah and Ed Zeppelin then left the lineup, with the latter''s brother Bruce and bassist Derf Nasna-Haj signing on for 1995''s No Quarter Pounder. Jah Paul Jo''s subsequent departure preceded 1996''s The Fun Sessions, the group''s lone recording for the Imago imprint; both the live The Song Remains Insane and the rarities collection Ruins soon followed. Deja Voodoo was released in late 2000, marking a return to the Led Zep tributes that constituted the group''s bread and butter. The band soon started their own label and website, creating a cottage industry selling music direct to their fans. Live DVDs and CDs plus their first all-original album, Spam Bake, kept hungry Dread Heads satisfied. The music/video hybrid CD Chicken and Ribs from 2005 included the band''s version of "Kung Fu Fighting".</p>', '/images/artists/Dread_Zeppelin.jpg'),

Her debut album, Frank (2003), earned heaps of praise and plenty of awards in the U.K., but it was her second release, Back to Black (2006), that made her a star in both the U.K. and the United States. With the vocal swagger of Nina Simone and the bad behavior of Janis Joplin, Winehouse gets attention from music critics and gossip journalists alike.

(270, 'Gerald Moore', '<p>Gerald Moore is generally considered the finest recital accompanist of the twentieth century. Known for his boundless facility and an unfailing ability to adapt to -- and elicit the best from -- his various musical partners, he was in constant demand for over 30 years, and he is represented on a huge number of fine recordings.</p><p>English-born, Moore began his musical education at the local Watford School of Music, where his piano teacher was Wallis Bandey. The family moved to Canada in 1913, at which point he took up studies with Michael Hambourg. He made his first stage appearances, both as a soloist and as an accompanist in Canada.</p><p>Moore returned to England in 1919; his teacher, Hambourg, referred him to his son, Mark Hambourg, for further study, and Moore began to make frequent appearances in England. In 1921 he accepted a recording contract with the EMI company, remaining with them his entire career. The composer, conductor, and pianist Sir Landon Ronald suggested to Moore that he had an exceptional talent as an accompanist and should concentrate on that art. In 1925 the eminent tenor John Coates asked Moore to become his permanent accompanist; Moore says that he learned the craft of accompanying from his work with Coates. They made their first joint appearances in 1926. Moore soon became sought-after as an accompanist.</p><p>His impeccable piano technique was characterized by a beautiful, singing legato touch and lovely, very flexible tone color that was partly the result of masterful use of the pedals. Most important, he was highly empathetic to his recital partners'' musical personality. Soon, international artists such as Pablo Casals, John McCormack, Hans Hotter, Maria Gerhard, Feodor Chaliapin, and Elisabeth Schumann made sure they could engage Moore when they appeared in England, or even have him with them on tours. It is not an exaggeration to say that Moore''s acceptance of an offer to accompany a new artist was a major indication of the newcomer''s promise. He was especially known for his song accompaniment, and made frequent and memorable appearances and recordings with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Janet Baker, Kathleen Ferrier, and many others.</p><p>While Moore was a master of the duo-piano sonata repertory, he did not form any permanent duo-piano partnership. He came more and more to concentrate on song recitals, and became a master of the repertory. Moore prompted wide exploration of the more neglected songs of Wolf, Schubert, and Richard Strauss, and participated in recordings of virtually all of the literally hundreds of songs by these masters. During World War II Dame Myra Hess, who had founded a series of lunch-time concert in the National Gallery (which had been emptied of its precious artwork as a safeguard against bomb damage), invited Moore to participate by giving illustrated lectures about the art of accompanying. He proved to be a highly engaging lecture personality, somehow projecting devotion to the highest artistic ideals in down-to-earth, unpretentious terms. After the war, he continued lecturing, making highly successful world-wide lecture tours.</p><p>He taught master classes in song interpretation. He published a book derived from his lecture material, The Unashamed Accompanist which is an engaging combination of forthright discussion of interpretation, mixed with autobiographical (even gossipy) material about working with some of the great stars of the classical music world. In addition, he published teaching books on accompanying and interpretation.</p><p>Moore retired from the concert stage in 1967, but continued to be active in the recording studio for some years. He is credited with having raised the status of the accompanist to that of a true musical partner with the soloist.</p>', '/images/artists/GeraldMoore.jpg'),
(271, 'Mela Tenenbaum, Pro Musica Prague & Richard Kapp', '<p>Richard Kapp was one of the more unique conductors of his age, viewing music as enjoyment and not as an angst-laden endeavor. He thus chose to focus on less-serious, less-cerebral compositions and became an iconic figure in that brighter world of classical music. Kapp had long been identified with the chamber group he founded, the Philharmonia Virtuosi of New York. With them he recorded a series of popular recordings dubbed by the label Columbia Masterworks as greatest-hits albums. The first, made in 1977, was one of the best-selling recordings of its time, The Greatest Hits of 1720. Kapp led his orchestra in numerous concerts in the New York area over the years and made many recordings for a variety of labels, including the aforementioned Columbia, Vox (and subsidiary labels Candide and Turnabout), Murray Hill, and his own ESS.AY.</p><p>Kapp was born on October 9, 1936, in Chicago into a musical family. Despite prodigious talent on the piano in his youth, Kapp studied German history at Johns Hopkins University. After his 1957 graduation, he enrolled at the Stuttgart Staatliche Hochschule für Musik, where he studied piano, conducting, and composition. From 1960-1962 he worked as repetiteur at the Basel Stadttheater (Switzerland), then served as music director at the Manhattan School of Music''s Opera Theater (1963-1965).</p><p>Though he would waver again, earning a law degree from New York University, he eventually chose music as his primary career when in 1968 he founded the Philharmonia Virtuosi. Its membership was mostly made up of players of exceptional talent, and soon Kapp was able to attract soloists of international renown. The ensemble played many of its concerts at Town Hall, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and other major sites in the New York area.</p><p>After his 1977 Greatest Hits album, Kapp had become a celebrity and subsequent recordings also drew attention, though not quite the high sales figures. The Greatest Hits of the 1900s, issued in 1986, was the last of the greatest-hits releases by Columbia. Kapp continued to record with some success and led the group in regular concerts until he was diagnosed with cancer in 2004. Many of Kapp''s recordings are still appearing in reissues; among the most recent of them is the 2006 CD on ESS.AY, Fasch: Three Suites for Orchestra, on which Kapp leads another group he was associated with, Kiev Pro Musica.</p>', '/images/artists/placeholder.gif'),
(274, 'Nash Ensemble', '<p>London-based Nash Ensemble is a chamber orchestra consisting of 11 regular members, though their number can vary widely according to the work performed. Their repertory is broad but favors modern works by English composers like Lennox Berkeley, Harrison Birtwistle, James MacMillan, and Mark-Anthony Turnage. They perform most of their subscription concerts at Wigmore Hall, but also appear at other locations, including the Royal Festival Hall''s Purcell Room and Queen Elizabeth Hall.</p><p>Founded in 1964 by Amelia Freedman, its longtime artistic director, the Nash Ensemble took its name from the famous Nash terraces in London, designed by architect John Nash. The ensemble initially developed its reputation in Great Britain, only slowly gaining recognition abroad.</p><p>Its first American tour took place in 1981, but the group remained little-known in the United States until the turn of the new century. In England, however, it had become recognized for its artistic achievements throughout the 1980s and, thereafter, both for concerts (which included premieres of many works written specifically for the group -- 113 by 2006) and for recordings.</p><p>Amelia Freedman was awarded an MBE (Member of the British Empire) in 1989 in recognition of her artistic contributions. Bath University gave her an honorary doctorate in 1993, both because of work with the Bath International Festival, which she directed from 1986-1993, and for her work in the realm of chamber music. </p><p>In the early ''80s, the Nash Ensemble began recording for the Hyperion label, its first releases were a disc of chamber works by Berkeley (1983) and three CDs of compositions by Malcolm Arnold (1984). Soon the group began recording with other labels as well, including CDR (Hummel and Berwald septets; 1989), and NMC (Turnage works; 1995). Beginning in the 1990s, recording activity intensified, both for Hyperion and other labels, including ASV and Black Box.</p><p>The 2005-2006 season again featured many new works by the ensemble, bringing its total to more than 250, and it also made tours of Germany and of England, with appearances at many festivals.</p>', '/images/artists/nashensamble.jpg'),
(276, 'Chic', '<p>Chic, the New York-based group that rose to the fore of the late 1970s dance scene, created a trade-mark sound driven by Nile Rodgers’s funky guitar riffs and Bernard Edwards’s throbbing bass lines. With stripped-down production, they stuck to the funk essentials of bass, rhythm guitar, drums, and vocals that were always deep in the mix. They scored a hit with their first single, "Dance, Dance, Dance," followed by "Le Freak." "Good Times," their last single to rise to the top of the charts, provided the rhythm track for the Sugarhill Gang’s "Rapper’s Delight," ground zero of the hip-hop sound. As Rickey Vincent wrote in his book Funk: The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One, "Chic captured with high-class panache the sleek sounds of the disco jet set by polishing the soulful spirit and jazzy chord progressions heard in the harder funk. Smart, tightly locked riffs, accessible simple vocals, and a groove just fonkey enough to breathe through the disco beat marked the formula."</p><p>Rodgers, who was born on September 19, 1952, i New York City, was classically trained and studied jazz guitar at the Manhattan School of Music. He performed with the jazz and rock quintet, New World Rising, in the 1960s, then joined the Apollo Theatre house band. Edwards, who was born in Greenville, North Carolina, in 1952, was introduced to Rodgers in 1970. Although he lacked Rodgers’s formal training, Edwards was already an experienced musician, and the two found that they complemented one another. They began the Big Apple Band in 1971, with Tony Thompson on drums, and backed up the vocal group New York City, playing on their hit single "I’m Doing Fine Now." The band continued to experiment on its own, with Rodgers, the former arranging student, taking jazz standards like "Porgy and Bess" and doing disco arrangements. Rodgers is quoted by Barry Alfonso in the liner notes to The Very Best of Chic as saying, "[T]hat’s how we got involved with the concept of dance music."</p><p>At the end of 1976, another band called Big Apple Band scored a hit with "A Fifth of Beethoven," which spurred Rodgers and Edwards to find a new name. Still working with Thompson, their musical ideas began to cohere in what would be their trademark sound. With the addition of Norma Jean Wright and Luci Martin as vocalists, they settled on a name: Chic.</p><p>The group realized, after early experimentation, that it was possible to "do sophisticated music in a way that speaks to the average person," as Rodgers told Alfonso. "That’s when the whole concept of disco be-came so exciting to us. I thought, Wow, I can use m jazz chops and my harmonic knowledge and still write a good pop melody over it."</p><p>In early 1977 the group laid down tracks for a demo. All the major labels in New York turned them down before they were picked up by Atlantic in September.Chic, the band’s debut album, was recorded in three weeks, and a single "Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah)" was quickly released. It rose to number six on both the pop and R&B Billboard charts in early 1978 and soon sold more than a million copies. As Alfonso points out, "[Dance, Dance, Dance’] was a template for further Chic hits to follow, riding on an unstoppable groove and carrying with it just a hint of irony in its lyrics." In addition to "Dance, Dance, Dance," the album included "Everybody Dance," a song that, when released as a single, rose to number 12 on the R&B charts. Wright left the band at the end of the year and was replaced by Luci Martin, a singer and dancer who had previously toured in productions of Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar.</p><p>In 1978 Chic released their sophomore effort, C’est Chic. The album included the song "Le Freak," which was to become their biggest hit. Written about a sexually suggestive dance originating in the fabled club Studio 54 and boasting simple, self-reflexive lyrics sung over a funky rhythm track, it was at the top of the American charts for five weeks following its October release. "Le Freak" became an international phenomenon, going gold in a number of different countries and marking what is probably the high point of the disco era. C’est Chic included "I Want Your Love," which charted at number five in pop and number seven in R&B. In addition to Alfa Anderson and Luci Martin, the album included guest vocals by Luther Vandross.</p><p>Chic’s watershed year was 1979. At the height of their powers and popularity, Rodgers and Edwards wrote and produced songs for Sister Sledge: "He’s the Greatest Dancer" and "We Are Family." Both songs would reach the top ten. That same year Chic released their third album, Risqué. The first single, "Good Times," became a smash hit. It occupied the number-two slot, behind Donna Summer’s "Bad Girls," for several weeks before reaching the top in August. "Good Times" is credited by Wilson & Alroy’s Record Reviews as being "probably the best late disco song of them all, with that hypnotic, endlessly repeating bass line, trademark guitar and strings in the background, and sing-along vocals." Of all the hits spawned by Rodgers and Edwards, "Good Times" would prove to be the most influential, providing the backing track for the Sugarhill Gang’s seminal hip-hop single, "Rapper’s Delight," and inspiring Queen’s "Another One Bites the Dust." "My Forbidden Lover," the follow-up single, failed to reach the heights of its predecessor, stalling at number 43. The backlash to discO’s popularity had begun with punk, New Wave, and resurgent rock jockeying for position.</p><p>By 1980 the social climate had changed significantly and Chic’s fourth album, Real People, was released to lukewarm response. It was their first album to not reach gold status. The album produced two singles, the title track and "Rebels Are We," which reached number eight on the R&B chart but failed to crack Billboard’s pop top 40. The album includes nods to the shifting musical landscape, with keyboards assuming a more prominent place in lieu of the strings. Rodgers’s minimalist funk-inflected guitar-playing expanded from keeping rhythm to playing leads.</p><p>In 1981 Chic released Take It Off, described by Alfonso as "[veering] toward a complex funk and rock amalgam." The 1982 album Tongue in Chic was released to little fanfare and no radio hits.Believer, released the following year, also failed to chart and marked the end of Chic’s relationship with Atlantic.</p><p>While the fortunes of the band waned, Rodgers and Edwards remained busy producing outside projects, both together and separately. In 1980 they produced Diana Ross’s album Diana, featuring "Upside Down" and "I’m Coming Out." The following year they collaborated on Debbie Harry’s album Koo Koo. Edwards produced an array of diverse artists, including Rod Stewart, Robert Palmer, and the Power Station, featuring Tony Thompson on drums. He also released a solo album, Glad to Be Here. Independent of Edwards, Rodgers would go on to produce David Bowie’s 1983 album Let’s Dance, as well as Madonna’s breakthrough album Like a Virgin. His solo album, Adventures in the Land of Groove, was released in 1983 but garnered little attention.</p><p>The members of Chic went their separate ways, with both Rodgers and Edwards concentrating on producing chores. In 1992 the two co-founders reunited to record Chi-cism on the Warner Bros, label. While the album showed both Rodgers and Edwards in good form, it failed to do as well as had been hoped. Rodgers and Edwards continued to perform as Chic through the mid-1990s, until Bernard Edwards’s 1996 death from pneumonia while he was touring Japan with the Power Station.</p>', '/images/artists/placeholder.gif'),
(277, 'Anita Ward', '<p>Perhaps more so than any other genre in the history of popular music, the ''70s disco scene was littered with countless one-hit wonders, including Anita Ward. Born during 1957 in Memphis, TN, Ward developed an interest in music at an early age, although it was gospel and not the up-tempo dance style she''d become synonymous with years later. Ward went on to sing with the Rust College A Cappella Choir (which included recording alongside renowned Metropolitan Opera vocalist Leontyne Price), as well as issuing an obscure album recorded by her own gospel quartet. But after graduation, Ward didn''t automatically set out to pursue a career in music and instead became a substitute teacher in the Memphis elementary school system. It wasn''t long before Ward realized music was too much a part of her life to ignore and her manager put her in contact with singer/songwriter Frederick Knight (who had scored a substantial hit on his own in the summer of 1972 with "I''ve Been Lonely for So Long"). Knight signed on to help produce a three-song demo session with Ward, but once the tape was rolling, Knight became so taken by Ward''s singing ability that the sessions soon produced an album''s worth of material.</p><p>Upon listening back to their work, both agreed that they were still one song short, which resulted in Knight digging up an old track titled "Ring My Bell" that he had originally penned for a young teenybopper singer, Stacy Lattisaw (who would later score several hits in the early ''80s). The song''s original lyrics dealt with teens chatting away on the phone and even though Knight gave the track a quick lyrical overhaul, Ward was less than enthusiastic about the song. Still, she agreed to record it (with Knight providing most of the musical accompaniment himself, including one of the first uses of synth drums on a record), which only took a total of two days to record. "Ring My Bell" turned out to be the best track of the bunch, resulting in a recording contract with the TK label, and the release of Ward''s debut album, Songs of Love, in 1979. It didn''t take long for "Ring My Bell" to scale the charts and it peaked at number one during the summer (out-gunning such other future disco-classics as Donna Summer''s "Hot Stuff" and "Bad Girls," plus Sister Sledge''s "We Are Family," all of which were in the Top Five) and remained on the charts for five months solid.</p><p>Since the song was a fluke to begin with, there weren''t any other tracks on the album that really resembled "Ring My Bell" (most were ballads and mid-tempo songs), resulting in the album disappearing from the charts soon after. A follow-up single, "Don''t Drop My Love," could only make it as far as number 87 on the charts in December of the same year, signaling that Ward''s 15 minutes had come and gone, delegating her to one-hit wonder status. Although Ward only scored a lone hit during her brief recording career, a 12-track best-of set was released in 1998, unsurprisingly titled Ring My Bell; a remix of the track, "Ring My Bell 2000," was issued shortly thereafter.</p>', '/images/artists/placeholder.gif'),

She collected numerous gold records and awards during her prime, but her career was plagued by contractual and management problems during the 1980s.</p>\r\n<p>Born in suburban Boston in 1948, LaDonna Andrea Gaines was one of seven siblings in a working-class household where church attendance and academic achievement were the rule. She began singing as a child in the gospel choir of her church, and was an especially devoted fan of gospel legend Mahalia Jackson. As a teenager, Summer sang in a Boston band called Crow, and shocked her family when she decided to move to New York City in order to find work on Broadway. At the age of 18, Summer auditioned for a role in the popular hippie musical Hair. She won a spot in the touring company for the show, and moved to Europe.</p>\r\n<p>Summer spent the next several years overseas. She appeared in several German and Austrian stage productions, met and married a fellow performer, Helmut Sommer--from whom she took her eventual recording name--modeled, and occasionally worked as a backup singer for recording artists. During a 1973 Munich recording session with the band Blood, Sweat & Tears, Summer met producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, who were entranced by her voice. She accepted an invitation to work with them, and recorded "The Hostage," her debut single. "The Hostage "and two other recordings became minor hits in European dance clubs.</p>\r\n<p>In 1975, Summer recorded a takeoff of a sexy, French hit from 1959, "Je T''Aime...Moi Non Plus." Her version of the song, entitled "Love to Love You Baby," featured a classic, speedy disco beat. The song was not a hit in Europe until Neil Bogart, an American record executive who had made a fortune with bubblegum pop records in the 1960s, suggested expanding the song to nearly 17 minutes in length. Summer was signed to Bogart''s Casablanca Records, and the shortened version of the song reached No. 2 on the American charts by early 1976.</p>\r\n<p>Summer has been called the first crossover artist in pop music history, an African American performer who began her recording career working in a genre that appealed to minorities--the denizens of the New York nightlife scene, in which African American, Latino, and gay culture thrived in its own unique mix. That underground popularity eventually attracted a more mainstream element. Record company executives began to realize that some of Summer''s recordings that were marketed for the discotheque scene were selling briskly in mainstream record stores as well, even though they received no airplay on the radio.</p>\r\n<p>The music industry journal Billboard created its disco chart in 1975. Summer soon began topping this chart, as well as the R&B and pop charts, with a string of hits. These hits included the 1976 releases A Love Trilogy, and the album Four Seasons of Love. The following year, she scored two more hits with the album I Remember Yesterday, and a double album, Once Upon a Time. All of these hits showcased Summer''s smooth, rich voice. One of Summer''s greatest hits, "I Feel Love," was released in mid-1977 as a single from I Remember Yesterday. It would be the first hit to use what became known as the "galloping bass line," a pounding, 140-beat-per-minute rhythm created by a drum machine. Such production techniques were rapidly adopted as a standard in disco music. Summer would also be remembered as the first female recording artist to successfully incorporate synthesizers into her work.</p>\r\n<p>During the late 1970s, Summer kept a nearly nonstop schedule of recording and performing, even spending nearly two straight years on tour. She was one of the most popular recording artists of her day. Her concerts sold out regularly, fans mobbed her, and her record sales were astronomical. In 1978, Summer appeared in a dismal feature film that tried to capitalize on the disco craze, Thank God It''s Friday. Despite the film''s failure at the box office, one of the songs from the soundtrack, "Last Dance" became a number one hit and earned Summer a Grammy award and an Oscar for Best Original Song. A number of her other hits found their way onto her 1978 double live album, Live and More, which was recorded from a series of shows at the Universal Amphitheater near Los Angeles. This was followed by her double studio album Bad Girls, which was released in the spring of 1979. Bad Girls spent six weeks on the American album charts, and was the best-selling album by a female artist in 1979. It also earned Summer a Grammy award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.</p>\r\n<p>Bad Girls would be one of the last records that Summer recorded for Casablanca. In late 1979, Casablanca released a compilation of Summer''s hits entitled, On the Radio--Greatest Hits, Volumes I and II. One of the songs on the album, Summer''s duet with Barbara Streisand entitled "No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)," topped the charts. In early 1980, Summer sued to be released from her contract with Casablanca, citing undue influence and fraud. Later that year, she became the first artist to sign with the Geffen label, which was founded by rising entertainment executive David Geffen. Elton John and John Lennon soon joined Summer on Geffen''s roster.</p>\r\n<p>The year 1980 was marked by other notable changes in Summer''s life. She wed musician Bruce Sudano, whose Brooklyn Dreams band had backed her on some tours, and announced that she was a born-again Christian. Her debut album on Geffen, The Wanderer, reflected this new spirituality. The album reached No. 3 on Billboard''s charts, but its singles charted only in the 30s--a dismal showing compared to the string of gold records Summer had earned for her previous singles. The Wanderer was also the last album that Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte produced for Summer.</p>\r\n<p>In 1982, Summer teamed with producer Quincy Jones and released the album Donna Summer. One of the singles from the album, "Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)," was a Top Ten hit. She also recorded a cover song with Jones entitled "State of Independence." Jones was also able to convince a roster of music legends--Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, and Stevie Wonder among them--to sing backup on the album. Jones later remarked that this experience had inspired his production of "We Are the World," the 1984 Ethiopian famine-relief recording. Under the settlement terms of her lawsuit against Casablanca, Summer was required to record one more album for the label, which was now a part of Polygram Records. The title track of the album She Works Hard for the Money, climbed to No. 3 on the U.S. charts in 1983.</p>\r\n<p>Summer tried unsuccessfully to be released from her recording contract with Geffen Records. Sales of her 1987 album, All Systems Go, were so poor that a planned North American concert tour was canceled. In the late 1980s, Summer turned to art as a means of creative expression. She began to paint large, Expressionist-style canvases, many of which sold for several thousands of dollars. In 1994, Summer moved to Nashville with her husband and young daughter. She recorded an album of Christmas carols with the Nashville Symphony, and continued to paint.</p>\r\n<p>In 1997, Summer appeared alongside Gloria Estefan and Chaka Khan at a benefit concert, Three Divas on Broadway. Her career was also bolstered by a pop-culture revival of the disco era during the late 1990s. In early 1998, Summer appeared at Carnegie Hall for a concert to benefit the Gay Men''s Health Crisis Center in New York. "After nearly two hours of mature ovations and controlled excitement...the remarkably well-behaved audience could no longer be contained," wrote Larry Flick in Billboard. "As she [Summer] began a salacious, guitar-drenched rendition of ''Hot Stuff,'' fans rushed down the red carpeted aisles toward the stage."</p>\r\n<p>By the end of the 1990s, Summer was signed to a recording contract with Epic Records. The company released yet another of her many best-selling anthologies, VH1 Presents Donna Summer: Live & More--Encore! She was also working on tracks for a planned musical autobiography, Ordinary Girl. "I think women have incredible powers," she told Rolling Stone''s Gina Zucker in 1999. "We can use both the intellectual side of the brain and the nurturing side, and we have to be proud of both."</p>\r\n<p>Best Original Song Oscar, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, 1978, for "Last Dance"; Best Female R&B Vocal Performance Grammy, National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, 1979, for "Last Dance"; Best Female Rock Vocal Performance Grammy, 1980, for "Hot Stuff"; Best Inspirational Performance Grammy, 1984, for "He''s a Rebel," and 1985, for "Forgive Me"; (with Giorgio Moroder) Best Dance Recording Grammy, 1998, for "Carry On."</p>\r\n<p>Selected discography</p>\r\n<ul><li>\r\nLove to Love You, Baby, Oasis, 1975.</li>\r\n<li>A Love Trilogy, Oasis, 1976.</li>\r\n<li>Four Seasons of Love, Casablanca, 1976.</li>\r\n<li>I Remember Yesterday, Casablanca, 1977.</li>\r\n<li>Live and More, Casablanca, 1978.</li>\r\n<li>Bad Girls, Casablanca, 1979.</li>\r\n<li>On the Radio--Greatest Hits, Volumes I and II, Casablanca, 1979.</li>\r\n<li>The Wanderer, Geffen, 1980.</li>\r\n<li>Donna Summer, Geffen, 1982.</li>\r\n<li>She Works Hard for the Money, Polygram, 1983.</li>\r\n<li>All Systems Go, Geffen, 1987.</li>\r\n<li>Another Place and Time, Atlantic, 1989.</li>\r\n<li>Christmas Spirit, Mercury, 1994.</li>\r\n<li>VH1 Presents Donna Summer: Live & More--Encore!, Epic, 1999.</li></ul>\r\n', '/images/artists/placeholder.gif'),

(1, 'Rock', 'Rock and Roll is a form of rock music developed in the 1950s and 1960s. Rock music combines many kinds of music from the United States, such as country music, folk music, church music, work songs, blues and jazz.'),
(2, 'Jazz', 'Jazz is a type of music which was invented in the United States. Jazz music combines African-American music with European music. Some common jazz instruments include the saxophone, trumpet, piano, double bass, and drums.'),
(3, 'Metal', 'Heavy Metal is a loud, aggressive style of Rock music. The bands who play heavy-metal music usually have one or two guitars, a bass guitar and drums. In some bands, electronic keyboards, organs, or other instruments are used. Heavy metal songs are loud and powerful-sounding, and have strong rhythms that are repeated. There are many different types of Heavy Metal, some of which are described below. Heavy metal bands sometimes dress in jeans, leather jackets, and leather boots, and have long hair. Heavy metal bands sometimes behave in a dramatic way when they play their instruments or sing. However, many heavy metal bands do not like to do this.'),
(4, 'Alternative', 'Alternative rock is a type of rock music that became popular in the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s. Alternative rock is made up of various subgenres that have come out of the indie music scene since the 1980s, such as grunge, indie rock, Britpop, gothic rock, and indie pop. These genres are sorted by their collective types of punk, which laid the groundwork for alternative music in the 1970s.'),
(5, 'Disco', 'Disco is a style of pop music that was popular in the mid-1970s. Disco music has a strong beat that people can dance to. People usually dance to disco music at bars called disco clubs. The word "disco" is also used to refer to the style of dancing that people do to disco music, or to the style of clothes that people wear to go disco dancing. Disco was at its most popular in the United States and Europe in the 1970s and early 1980s. Disco was brought into the mainstream by the hit movie Saturday Night Fever, which was released in 1977. This movie, which starred John Travolta, showed people doing disco dancing. Many radio stations played disco in the late 1970s.'),
(6, 'Blues', 'The blues is a form of music that started in the United States during the start of the 20th century. It was started by former African slaves from spirituals, praise songs, and chants. The first blues songs were called Delta blues. These songs came from the area near the mouth of the Mississippi River.'),
(7, 'Latin', 'Latin American music is the music of all countries in Latin America (and the Caribbean) and comes in many varieties. Latin America is home to musical styles such as the simple, rural conjunto music of northern Mexico, the sophisticated habanera of Cuba, the rhythmic sounds of the Puerto Rican plena, the symphonies of Heitor Villa-Lobos, and the simple and moving Andean flute. Music has played an important part recently in Latin America''s politics, the nueva canción movement being a prime example. Latin music is very diverse, with the only truly unifying thread being the use of Latin-derived languages, predominantly the Spanish language, the Portuguese language in Brazil, and to a lesser extent, Latin-derived creole languages, such as those found in Haiti.'),
(8, 'Reggae', 'Reggae is a music genre first developed in Jamaica in the late 1960s. While sometimes used in a broader sense to refer to most types of Jamaican music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that originated following on the development of ska and rocksteady.'),
(9, 'Pop', 'Pop music is a music genre that developed from the mid-1950s as a softer alternative to rock ''n'' roll and later to rock music. It has a focus on commercial recording, often oriented towards a youth market, usually through the medium of relatively short and simple love songs. While these basic elements of the genre have remained fairly constant, pop music has absorbed influences from most other forms of popular music, particularly borrowing from the development of rock music, and utilizing key technological innovations to produce new variations on existing themes.'),
(10, 'Classical', 'Classical music is a very general term which normally refers to the standard music of countries in the Western world. It is music that has been composed by musicians who are trained in the art of writing music (composing) and written down in music notation so that other musicians can play it. Classical music can also be described as "art music" because great art (skill) is needed to compose it and to perform it well. Classical music differs from pop music because it is not made just in order to be popular for a short time or just to be a commercial success.'),
(11, 'Hip Hop', 'Hip Hop is a form of musical expression and artistic culture that originated in African-American communities during the late 1970s in New York City. DJ Afrika Bambaataa outlined the four pillars of Hip-hop culture: MCing, DJing, breaking and graffiti writing. Other elements include beatboxing. Since its emergence in the South Bronx, Hip-hop culture has spread around the world. Hip-hop music first emerged with disc jockeys creating rhythmic beats by looping breaks (small portions of songs emphasizing a percussive pattern) on two turntables, more commonly referred to as sampling. This was later accompanied by "rap", a rhythmic style of chanting or poetry presented in 16 bar measures or time frames, and beatboxing, a vocal technique mainly used to imitate percussive elements of the music and various technical effects of hip hop DJ''s. An original form of dancing and particular styles of dress arose among fans of this new music. \r\nThese elements experienced considerable refinement and development over the course of the history of the culture.\r\nThe relationship between graffiti and hip-hop culture arises from the appearance of new and increasingly elaborate and pervasive forms of the practice in areas where other elements of hip hop were evolving as art forms, with a heavy overlap between those who wrote graffiti and those who practiced other elements of the culture.');
